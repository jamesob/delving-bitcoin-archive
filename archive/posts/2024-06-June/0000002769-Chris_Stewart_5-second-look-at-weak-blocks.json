Would these blocks be competing chain tips or blocks built on top of one another? \n\nI think i conceptually understand how this would work if each weak block were competing chain tips. \n\nI don't understand how weak blocks could be built on top of each other - especially when receiving various weak blocks from a divergent set of miners across the p2p network? \n\nThanks in advance for clarification :raised_hands:",
