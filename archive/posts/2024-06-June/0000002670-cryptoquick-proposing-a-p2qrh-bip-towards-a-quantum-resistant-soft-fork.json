(For more on why SQIsign is chosen, see the Security section.) A constraint is that no hard fork or modifications leading to an increase in block size are necessary. This document is inspired by [https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki BIP-341], which introduced the design of the P2TR address format using Schnorr signatures.\n\n=== Copyright ===\n\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n  This file has been truncated. <a href=\"https://github.com/cryptoquick/bips/blob/61aac1a91a596cdeed75ed7f5c5c19b0b4b923ef/bip-p2qrh.mediawiki\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">show original</a>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>(Cross-posting from the Bitcoin Mailing list, for visibility)</p>",
