I do have a few additional thoughts on this use case:\n\n1. If a user was interested in the likelihood of feasibility of a payment from all other nodes he might want to look at the histogram of amounts that he could receive from any user. So for a given random wealth distribution (which can be [sampled with this library](https://pypi.org/project/drs/) as [explained in this notebook](https://github.com/renepickhardt/Lightning-Network-Limitations/blob/906b3a4d691cbfb30c2f385c6697b4fe2bb81676/Limits%20of%20two%20party%20channels/A%20Mathematical%20Theory%20of%20Payment%20Channel%20Networks.ipynb)) he could use [this method to compute a feasible network state](https://github.com/renepickhardt/Lightning-Network-Limitations/pull/2). From here one could use [Gomory-Hu Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomory%E2%80%93Hu_tree) to compute the all pair max flow more efficiently than computing a min flow problem from every user to Bob. Similar to [this notebook one could compute the distribution of max flows / min cuts](https://github.com/renepickhardt/Lightning-Network-Limitations/blob/906b3a4d691cbfb30c2f385c6697b4fe2bb81676/likelihood-of-payment-possability/An%20upper%20Bound%20for%20the%20Probability%20to%20be%20able%20to%20successfully%20conduct%20a%20Payment%20on%20the%20Lightning%20Network.ipynb)  and have a more precise view. This is because besides the percentile of nodes that are below the amount which Bob wishes to receive one would also get confidence intervals (if for example this method was repeated for several random wealth distributions). **Important**: Assuming random liquidity in channels as I have done in the notebook to compute the min cut distribution is probably not as precise as starting from random wealth distributions. \n\n2. Of course when sampling random wealth distributions Bob could take into account that he ownes `x` coins in his channels.
