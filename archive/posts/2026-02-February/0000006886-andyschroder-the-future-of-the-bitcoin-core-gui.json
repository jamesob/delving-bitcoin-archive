This, in turn, enables the monitoring of new addresses/scripts and tracking balance changes without the need to repeatedly download the entire blockchain.\n\nThe first project milestone introduces the feature for prune nodes that construct and maintain a local block filters set database. The node will request and keep track of the missing historical blocks that match the wallet scripts filters set to subsequently perform the rescan.\n\n#### The following sections are ordered by their PRs dependencies:\n\n##### Net: Single Block Requests Tracking System and On Download Failure Retry Mechanism\n* [x] #28170\n* [x] #28120\n* [x] #30118\n* [ ] #27837\n\n##### Indexes Stability and Performance Improvements\n* [X] #27607\n* [X] #27720\n* [x] #28955\n* [ ] #26966\n\n##### Wallet Rescan (depends on the net section)\n* [X] #27469\n* [ ] Cache wallet filters' set and connect it to the current wallet rescan functionality. (Pending)\n* [ ] Wallet: implement \"rescan status\" class to track the progress and retrieve it via an RPC command. (Pending)\n* [ ] Wallet: introduce prune node rescan functionality. (Pending - depends on net changes)\n\n#### Issues Solved By This Work\n\n* [ ] #21267\n* [ ] #23727\n* [&nbsp;] #27188\n* [&nbsp;] #27652\n* [&nbsp;] #27939\n* [ ] https://github.com/sparrowwallet/sparrow/issues/1111#issuecomment-2054204911</span></p>\n  </div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>could be fixed and we could have better pruned node support that can take efficiently take advantage of watching only wallets like Sparrow Wallet does through the already existent RPC. Sparrow is a killer UI and the main reason I think it doesn\u2019t encourage connecting to a local instance of bitcoin core (or even bundling it with Sparrow) is because wallet rescan is too slow and difficult to manage when nodes are pruned. I think a lot of people can deal with a one time 1-2 day wait to do full validation if they don\u2019t need to use much disk space after that and can do a rescan more quickly for any new wallet that needs to be added. If that barrier were eliminated, I think there could be a lot more Sparrow Wallet users running bitcoin core locally and more wallets that are built that have a similar way that they interact with bitcoin core (and potentially bundle it) as Sparrow Wallet does.</p>",
