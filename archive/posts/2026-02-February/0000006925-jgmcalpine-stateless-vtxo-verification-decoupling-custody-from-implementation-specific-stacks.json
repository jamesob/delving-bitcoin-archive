You're entirely right, and the 'state change + cpfp' paradigm is exactly what VTXOs should cleanly map onto. The '20 levels deep' example was admittedly an exaggerated hypothetical to illustrate the divergence between consensus-validity and policy-validity.\n\nMy main point regarding the Policy Auditor is about client-side enforcement, the 'Trust, but Verify' aspect of that paradigm.
