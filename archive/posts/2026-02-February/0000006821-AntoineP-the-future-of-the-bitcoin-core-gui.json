  "cooked": "<p>A year ago i posted a call to action regarding Bitcoin Core\u2019s priorities, which led to interesting discussions between some Bitcoin Core contributors and some community members in <a href=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/antoine-poinsot-on-bitcoin-cores-priorities/1470\">this thread</a>. Not much has really happened since, in terms of taking a decision on priorities, or even on agreeing to a common goal for the project. Until today, when the Bitcoin Core GUI maintainer <a href=\"https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2026-02-12.html#l-203\">called during the weekly Bitcoin Core meeting</a> for the deprecation of the GUI (which has been on life support for half a decade) and its eventual removal.</p>\n<p>I open this thread to revisit this topic in light of this update and enable a longer form -and hopefully more productive- discussion than the IRC meeting allows for.</p>\n<p>First and foremost, i must say it is frustrating how much wishful thinking is involved every single time this topic is brought up. I hope we can have a discussion without speaking in absolutes but considering the reality of the limited resources of the project.</p>\n<details>\n<summary>Click to expand longer rant on wishful thinking</summary> \n<p>During this week\u2019s meeting we again read statements such as \u201cusers should (<img src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/images/emoji/twitter/tm.png?v=15\" title=\":tm:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":tm:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">) be able to use Bitcoin without a third-party frontend\u201d, or \u201cwe must ship a GUI\u201d. Of course any contributor to Bitcoin Core would agree that all other things equal, making Bitcoin Core more useful and accessible is better! The point is obviously that all other things are <strong>not equal</strong>, and the decision for Bitcoin Core to ship a GUI should not be met with an unrealistic \u201cWe Must (<img src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/images/emoji/twitter/tm.png?v=15\" title=\":tm:\" class=\"emoji\" alt=\":tm:\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\">)\u201d, but rather beg the question \u201cat what costs?\u201d. Costs related to shipping a GUI come in various forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>direct burden related to maintenance of this component (bug fixing, build system compatibility, etc..);</li>\n<li>indirect burden related to both the presence and the active development of this component (unrelated maintenance of more important parts of the codebase ends up affecting this component, which needs fixing, or just concurrent development of this component conflicting with development in other parts of the software);</li>\n<li>direct risks related to shipping this component when it is significantly less reviewed and maintained than other parts of the software, and pulls significantly more less well-reviewed or naturally more at-risk dependencies;</li>\n<li>indirect risks related to shipping this component (risks from one component could <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/29914\">leak</a> into another, it invites code churns, and of course any limited resource spent on derisking shipping this component is not allocated to derisking more critical components);</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The costs exist. You may argue they are manageable, or that the benefits of shipping a GUI outweigh them. But simply stating that we must push through no matter the costs is absolutely unconvincing, and growingly frustrating after years of no development, barely any maintenance and tons of funding poured in dead-end projects that bring more churn (and therefore risk) to the project than they solve real world problems.</p>\n</details>\n<p>With that being said, let me try to summarize what i think are compelling points made during the meeting to try and kick-off discussions.</p>\n<p><a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/hebasto\">@Hebasto</a> starts off by stating:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Deprecate and abandon the Bitcoin Core GUI. It is insufficiently developed and reviewed, and current users have viable alternatives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is in my opinion one of the main points of this discussion, and it was barely even discussed during the meeting. What should be our quality threshold for software we release?

If we stopped shipping the GUI in version 34.0 (roughly, end of 2027) as per the GUI maintainer\u2019s suggested plan, users would either not be able to upgrade anymore or be forced to use the CLI.

Some people <a href=\"https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2026-02-12.html#l-294\">raised concerns</a> that since Bitcoin Core has shipped a GUI for so long, it disappearing in favour of alternatives not distributed by Bitcoin Core may be a fertile ground for distributing malware. If reasonable independently-distributed alternative(s) exist, do we believe we can then stop releasing a GUI? Or should we keep releasing one forever?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth pointing out the IPC interface for those alternatives is not currently available in any released version of Bitcoin Core, and most likely also won\u2019t be included in the upcoming version 31. That being said, multiple contributors pointed out that IPC is not a strict requirement for a GUI. The available RPC interface enables an application to have access to wallet functionalities and therefore be compatible with Bitcoin Core wallets. Nobody has ever built an RPC-based GUI specifically to manage a Bitcoin Core wallet, although there exists GUIs built on top of the Bitcoin Core RPC interface to manage a more modern wallet (backed by a watchonly Core wallet for monitoring the chain).</p>\n<p>Finally, all those points raised during the meeting are about direct costs (is it reasonable to ship the GUI? Who will take care of maintaining it?), but i\u2019m also interested in what people think about indirect costs and risk. Do we think the indirect burden and risks of keeping the GUI around is worth it? If so, who will make sure it at least does not break, or better yet maintain it?</p>",
