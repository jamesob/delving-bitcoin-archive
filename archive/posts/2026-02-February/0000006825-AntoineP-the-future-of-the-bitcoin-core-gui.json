  "cooked": "<p>In my opinion, we should center the discussion around support for existing Bitcoin Core wallet users.</p>\n<p>It is <a href=\"https://antoinep.com/posts/stating_the_obvious/\">obvious</a> to me that if Bitcoin Core never had any wallet or GUI, it would be ridiculous to suggest that Core contributors take some time off maintaining the software underpinning a trillion-dollars network to develop and maintain yet-another Bitcoin wallet/GUI. Of course, this is not to say that those have not been historically important components, material to Bitcoin\u2019s success. But Bitcoin is very different now than when they were introduced. There are now superior alternatives to both, and the mission of maintaining the node has become critical, with orders of magnitude more people (and value) that depend on it, and this is where our focus should be.</p>\n<p>That said, precisely because Bitcoin Core has shipped with a wallet and a GUI for so long, such a shift can\u2019t happen overnight. So i agree on the goal, but i am not sure about the timeline. I agree with marking it as deprecated ASAP, if only to set expectations for users that it does not meet the bar we set for ourselves and may be removed in the future. But there is currently no reasonable replacement to manage a Bitcoin Core wallet. So to buy into the complete removal timeline i would like to first be convinced that the burden of keeping the GUI around is a higher cost than its users being unable to upgrade their node and their wallet past version 34.</p>\n<p>Let me also try and propose and alternative plan. My main issue with the proposed timeline is that it may lead to part of our users being stuck on version 34, and not be able to get security updates for their full nodes nor their wallet. Of course if nobody is willing to maintain this component anymore, we can\u2019t force them to keep doing it, and users will have to move to a different wallet or use the CLI. That\u2019s not the end of the world, but i hope we can offer a smoother transition, whereby users may not update their GUI until there is interest in developing it, but may still be able to receive security updates for their full node and wallet.</p>\n<p>What i\u2019m suggesting is to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Let go of the sunk cost fallacy of the update to QML for the time being. Clearly this is not happening, or at least not until the GUI is cleanly split off from the main Bitcoin Core project and people can more easily iterate.</li>\n<li>Release the existing GUI only as a separate process that talks to the node and the wallet through the IPC interface.</li>\n<li>Split off the GUI into its own project, released at its own schedule.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I had previously heard that QT widget would be deprecated, but turns out it <a href=\"https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/log-2026-02-12.html#l-420\">will not</a>. So that seems reasonable to focus on the existing GUI than the forever-1-year-away one.</p>\n<p>We have as a project already chosen to bear most of the cost of multiprocess (additional dependencies), so we may as well reap all the benefits and include the remaining interfaces. Of course that\u2019s still a lot of work. Off the top of my head we\u2019d need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Merge the remaining interfaces;</li>\n<li>Merge process spawning logic;</li>\n<li>Figure out Windows support for multiprocess;</li>\n<li>Figure out some stability guarantees for the interface that would be used by the GUI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There would also be costs associated with a split, notably in terms of some code and build system logic duplication. That\u2019s a non-trivial amount of work (though most items have been implemented already), but not more than building an entirely new GUI, and in my opinion preferable to stopping to release a GUI altogether when no alternative is available. This also enables the competition between alternative GUIs talked about in the gist, if anybody becomes interested in taking part in that. Delivering this for version 34, as per the original timeline, seems achievable.</p>\n<p>Now i\u2019ll try to answer the specific questions i asked everyone in OP.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"AntoineP\" data-post=\"1\" data-topic=\"2253\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/user_avatar/delvingbitcoin.org/antoinep/48/483_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> AntoineP:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What should be our quality threshold for software we release?
