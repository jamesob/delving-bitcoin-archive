It\u2019s now been a few months since then, so we can examine confirmed transactions to how much impact those changes have had.

Here\u2019s the distribution of sizes \u2013 you can see 50% of txs have less than 210 bytes of OP_RETURN data, but equally 50% have more than that; 10% have more than 10kB of OP_RETURN

So large OP_RETURNS accounted for 0.44% of usage by bytes, versus 0.0016% counting by transactions. (Only comparing to transactions with an OP_RETURN output)\n * There were 34,283 txs burning sats to OP_RETURN outputs, for a total of 1,463,488 sats burnt. Largest burn was [931774:2482](https://mempool.space/tx/f4d62b6bf8389f1c0a7846e8995882aa28eae11f97e6ecf555cab9ac48db73b3) with 69,630 sats burnt. Only one tx both burnt funds and had more than 83 bytes of OP_RETURN data, namely [930086:2470](https://mempool.space/tx/3dff1964b6d1d2f53c15afbadfebad8b155a131345ce8ecb276fc85e3f3e9d17).\n * I think there are 949,003 txs with between 43 and 83 bytes of OP_RETURN data, and 23,412,911 txs with OP_RETURN data of 42 bytes or less (ie compliant with the limit Knots used prior to its 29.2 release)",
