Every ecash note is 1:1 with custodial bitcoin by the fedimint nodes. The most common critique of fedimint also stems from this 1:1 bitcoin:ecash since <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/callebtc/ed5228d1d8cbaade0104db5d1cf63939\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ecash proof of liabilities</a> is not a solved problem.</p>\n<p><strong>Offline</strong> - It\u2019s data (transfer it without the internet)</p>\n<p>This can make it ideal for places with poor connectivity (conferences/large gatherings or the developing world). This presents a trust race condition though, if the sender were malicious, they could race to get online faster than the receiver, and redeem the \u201csent\u201d ecash thus causing any attempts by the receiver to redeem the ecash notes to fail.</p>\n<p><strong>Modular</strong> - Default modules are wallet, mint, and LN</p>\n<p>Different modules can be designed using a core primitive called <code>Transaction</code> that has a set of inputs, a set of outputs, and a signature. These are then signed into consensus by the nodes of the fedimint. However, a module does not need to use a <code>Transaction</code>, it can just store arbitrary data as a <code>ConsensusItem</code> in the fedimint. A simple example of this is a password manager. A more complex example would be stability pools (stable fiat price for users doing finance magic I don\u2019t understand yet). I believe fedimint modules can become an interoperability point for lots of other tech and Bitcoin.</p>\n<p><strong>You don\u2019t have to do the LN thing</strong> - Best feature, imho</p>\n<p>A fedimint node runner, does not have to also run a Bitcoin node or a LN node. They can just run <code>fedimintd</code> and connect to some other Bitcoin node of their choice with all the standard trade offs. A LN node can join a fedimint as a special client called a <code>gateway</code>. They can then offer their liquidity to the fedimint users. Ecash can then be swapped for LN based sats, and vice versa, using the module system. This means a super awesome LN node operator can do what they do best and the fedimint node runner doesn\u2019t have to manage the challenges of a LN node. Currently CLN and LND are supported and both require the running of <code>gatewayd</code> to connect/interact with the fedimint.</p>\n<p>There are probably some more features, but these are the ones top of mind to myself.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"naive-approach-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#naive-approach-3\"></a>Naive Approach</h2>\n<p>A mining pool needs a coinbase address to put into a block. The pool just joins a fedimint and gets a deposit address for each block they mine. After the block confirms beyond the fedimint\u2019s desired block count, the pool can then redeem ecash from the fedimint. Using the same accounting for shares and payout, the pool sends ecash to the miners. The miners can then go to the fedimint at their leisure and swap for on-chain or LN sats. The pool operator is not managing a fedimint node, nor a LN node. The trust remains relatively the same between the miners and pool. You\u2019re trusting the pool to not rug you and/or double spend you. However, this would require the miners to form another relationship with a new entity: the fedimint and its node runners.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"poolimint-module-all-modules-should-be-imint-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#poolimint-module-all-modules-should-be-imint-4\"></a><code>poolimint</code> module (all modules should be <code>-imint</code>)</h2>\n<p>There are some ideas discussed in <a href=\"https://github.com/fedimint/fedimint/discussions/1504\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">this GitHub Discussion</a> but I hope to explore some more thoughts and pose some questions I have.</p>\n<p>First, some observation I have made/learned (please correct if wrong):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>latency is a big deal in mining</li>\n<li>Sv2 enables anyone to generate the block template</li>\n<li>LN doesn\u2019t work for pools because liquidity challenges</li>\n<li>small miners want faster/smaller payouts (me!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since latency for block generation is a critical aspect of pool technology, I think it best that fedipools follow the Sv2 model and delegate that to where it makes sense.
