  "raw": "> it doesn\u2019t significantly change the onchain footprint of DLCs\n\nThat's correct, but it dramatically improves the UI/UX related to DLCs. There's at minimum a 30x improvement in computation (with an even larger improvement for multi-oracle), plus you don't need to pass signatures back & forth (so you don't run into bandwidth constraints).\n\nIn practice, bandwidth constraints significantly affect current DLC implementations, since users not only need to create a large number of signatures but also share those signatures with their counterparty, receive those signatures from their counterparty, and back up the signatures of both parties. 5k CETs ends up being around 5mb (10mb total for offeror and acceptor), takes around 5-10 seconds on mobile to create, and 60-90 seconds (or more) to pass back and forth and back up. \n\nIn practice, this is the difference between taking ~2 minutes to enter a DLC on a mobile app, to ~10 seconds or less, since you don't have to pass all these signatures back and forth and back them up. \n\n> DLCs have been operational for several years but have not seen any major use that I\u2019m aware of\n\nThis is historically true, but it has changed quite a bit lately.
