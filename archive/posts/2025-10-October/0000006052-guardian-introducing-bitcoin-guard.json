  "cooked": "<p><strong>What is Bitcoin Guard?</strong></p>\n<p>Earlier this year I read an article about a person who was kidnapped and tortured for their bitcoin. It was the third such article I\u2019d read in a couple of weeks, and the details &amp; circumstances concerned me. I thought to myself there must be a technical solution to the growing number of physical attacks, and Bitcoin Guard is my effort to shift the balance of power from the attacker to the victim. The (draft) BIPs are available for anybody to implement and all code is open source. My motivation to build this is to make self-sovereign security available for everyone by changing game theory outcomes, adjusting the risk/reward for the attacker to increase risk and reduce reward. If adoption is large enough, this creates protective value since the attacker does not know if Guardians are configured, if there\u2019s a physical response, and visually wallets are locked.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to provide both technical enforcement that prevents bitcoin theft and enhance the physical security posture of the user.</p>\n<p>A lightweight signalling protocol is implemented in a  bitcoin address which sets a boolean lock state. The subsequent lock state transition is a pre-signed transaction, which enables users to activate the emergency signal without carrying private key material.</p>\n<p>This opens a wide range of activation methods as the implementation only has to <code>curl -X POST &lt;sig&gt; &lt;rpc&gt;</code> to lock the Guardian.</p>\n<p>Since the protocol and implementation are (draft) BIPs, the wallet behaviour may be deployed by both self-custodial wallets and centralised exchanges, making this design suitable for a range of custody environments.</p>\n<p>There are several components to this design:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin Guard Desktop Application</li>\n<li>Bitcoin Guard Mobile Application</li>\n<li>Guardian Address Signal Protocol Draft (GASPv1) BIP</li>\n<li>Guardian Wallet Implementation Draft BIP</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From a UX perspective my goal is to make Guardian Addresses simple to use without knowing any protocol specifics. If the user knows how to use a hardware wallet they can use Bitcoin Guard effectively.</p>\n<p>Please note all features are in active development and may be subject to change.</p>\n<p><strong>Bitcoin Guard Mobile</strong></p>\n<p>When the Guardian is locked, monitoring wallets prohibit spending. The mobile app is where many of the security features are configured and used.</p>\n<p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/uploads/default/original/2X/0/020b886854fb52d678c76bce5fb5318090d1fb2a.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/uploads/default/020b886854fb52d678c76bce5fb5318090d1fb2a\" title=\"bitcoinguardmobile\"><img src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/020b886854fb52d678c76bce5fb5318090d1fb2a_2_288x500.jpeg\" alt=\"bitcoinguardmobile\" data-base62-sha1=\"i5FabHyHOE0GNQPOVvFQLKTetA\" width=\"288\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/020b886854fb52d678c76bce5fb5318090d1fb2a_2_288x500.jpeg, https://delvingbitcoin.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/020b886854fb52d678c76bce5fb5318090d1fb2a_2_432x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://delvingbitcoin.org/uploads/default/optimized/2X/0/020b886854fb52d678c76bce5fb5318090d1fb2a_2_576x1000.jpeg 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"363229\"><div class=\"meta\"><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#far-image\"></use></svg><span class=\"filename\">bitcoinguardmobile</span><span class=\"informations\">806\u00d71396 115 KB</span><svg class=\"fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><use href=\"#discourse-expand\"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>\n<p>An interactive prototype is available to try at <a href=\"https://bitcoinguardian.github.io/mobile-prototype\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bitcoin Guard Mobile</a></p>\n<p><strong>Trusted Contact</strong></p>\n<p>If a device is stolen by an attacker, such as in a street robbery, it might be difficult for the victim to broadcast the Guardian Lock.</p>\n<p>The app supports multiple Locks ready to broadcast, so if a trusted contact has one of the victim\u2019s pre-signed Locks, they can broadcast it on behalf of the victim.</p>\n<p>Locks may only be used once, so if a user\u2019s signature is broadcast maliciously the impact is limited to a single lock instance which is fully recoverable.
