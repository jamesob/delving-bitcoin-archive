Verification scales logarithmically with computation size, allowing to set an upper bound that is sufficient for all use cases (i.e. at least support recursive proof verification), and hence that enables static pricing in Bitcoin\u2019s weight unit system (pricing the worse case).</p>\n<p>Integration of the Stone verifier would add a single opcode that consumes a serialized and compressed STARK proof, from the stack, succeeding if the proof verifies and failing otherwise. Proof sizes are typically in the range of hundreds of KB to 1 MB uncompressed, but compression (e.g., bzip2) could reduce them below 100 KB in many cases. On-chain verification time would be in the order of 10s of milliseconds on standard hardware, depending on proof parameters.</p>\n<p>Potential use cases include that could help Bitcoin improve as money:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Validity rollups for scaling Bitcoin L1: verify state transition given the onchain state commitments.</li>\n<li>Post-quantum signature aggregation: replace a large number of PQ signatures with a single succinct proof of their correctness.</li>\n<li>Privacy features like shielded transactions: spend UTXOs by providing a ZK proof of funds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And some other stuff:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Proof or reserves / liabilities schemes for Cashu: use STARK proofs to prove the Mint is acting correctly, or users prove that the Mint is cheating.

The goal is to enable on-chain verification of a Zero Knowledge Proof with transparent, post-quantum-secure assumptions, without resorting to ad-hoc Script encodings (e.g., `OP_CAT`) or enshrining a large family of arithmetic opcodes. We outline the motivation, threat model, bounding/pricing approach, initial opcode semantics, and open questions. Feedback welcome on scope,\nparameter bounding, pricing, alternatives, and challenges.\n\nIt is clear that this proposal is far from being fully fleshed, and presents already multiple significant challenges, the main one being about credible neutrality with respect to the need of choosing a specific flavor of STARK protocol.\n\nThe main goal is to gauge the interest about enshrining native ZK verification (i.e OP_STARK_VERIFY, OP_GROTH16_VERIFY) into Bitcoin at some point.\n\nIt\u2019s also an interesting thought experiment to start thinking about the challenges that this would imply.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThere is increasing interest in enabling zero-knowledge proof verification within Bitcoin to support applications such as Validity rollups, post-quantum signatures, and privacy-preserving transactions. Current approaches, like BitVM-style optimistic fraud proofs with ZK verification, rely on off-chain computation and on-chain challenge mechanisms, introducing complexities such as delayed finality, capital lockup, and additional trust assumptions.\n\nThis post proposes a native opcode, OP_STARK_VERIFY, to directly verify [STARK (Scalable Transparent ARgument of Knowledge) proofs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/046.pdf) in Bitcoin Script. This aims to provide efficient, on-chain verification without the drawbacks of indirect methods.\n\nThe proposal focuses on vanilla STARKs, as implemented in Stone, due to their established understanding, production use, and formal properties. Newer variants like Circle STARKs (used in the successor Stwo prover) offer substantial improvements in terms of speed and overall efficiency but are less mature and understood. The choice of Stone is driven by its battle-tested nature, formal verification, and suitability for integration into Bitcoin Core.\n\n## Motivation\n\nSTARKs provide post-quantum secure, transparent proofs with poly-logarithmic verification complexity and sublinear proof sizes relative to computation size.
