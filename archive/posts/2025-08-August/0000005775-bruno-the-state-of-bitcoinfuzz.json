I originally created it as an experiment, and the first version was quite rough with a poor design.\nAs the project started gaining attention, I refactored it to follow a modular approach similar to cryptofuzz. It means that you can choose which projects you want to fuzz, and you can build the projects (we call modules) individually.</p>\n<p>The first targets that I wrote were descriptor and miniscript parsers, where we found many bugs. The first one we reported was in sipa\u2019s miniscript implementation, which incorrectly considered <code>pk()()</code> as a valid policy because it identifies <code>)(</code> as the name. Currently, we have many other targets like: script evaluation, descriptor parse, miniscript parse, addrv2, psbt, address parse, and others. We plan to expand and work on additional targets in the near future.</p>\n<p>So far, we discovered and reported over 35 bugs in projects such as btcd, rust-bitcoin, rust-miniscript, Embit, Bitcoin Core, Core Lightning, LND, etc. Examples include: many implementations using the incorrect type for the key\u2019s type value for PSBTs, the CVE-2024-44073 of rust-miniscript, panic on btcd\u2019s PSBT parser ( <a href=\"https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/issues/2351\" class=\"inline-onebox\">[bug]: PSBT Parser Panic: Missing Bounds Check in ReadBip32Derivation() \u00b7 Issue #2351 \u00b7 btcsuite/btcd \u00b7 GitHub</a> ), Embit incorrectly pointing a miniscript as valid ( <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoinfuzz/bitcoinfuzz/issues/113\" class=\"inline-onebox\">miniscript_parse: crash with `ttvtvtvtvtvtvtv:after(2)` \u00b7 Issue #113 \u00b7 bitcoinfuzz/bitcoinfuzz \u00b7 GitHub</a> ), Core Lightning accepting invoices with non-standard witness address fallbacks that other implementations correctly reject ( <a href=\"https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/pull/8219\" class=\"inline-onebox\">Enforce minimum witness program length for fallback addresses in BOLT11 parsing by erickcestari \u00b7 Pull Request #8219 \u00b7 ElementsProject/lightning \u00b7 GitHub</a> ).</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-5775-what-are-the-current-projects-we-support-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5775-what-are-the-current-projects-we-support-2\"></a>What are the current projects we support?</h2>\n<p>We currently integrate and support the following projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitcoin Core - C++</li>\n<li>rust-bitcoin - Rust</li>\n<li>rust-miniscript - Rust</li>\n<li>embit - Python</li>\n<li>btcd - Golang</li>\n<li>LDK - Rust</li>\n<li>LND - Golang</li>\n<li>Core Lightning - C</li>\n<li>NLightning - C#</li>\n<li>NBitcoin - C#</li>\n<li>Eclair - Scala</li>\n<li>lightning-kmp - Kotlin</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is a PR (under review) that integrates libbitcoin. We welcome any PR that integrates more projects into bitcoinfuzz. However, we intend to review the support of some implementations since an immature implementation can hinder differential fuzzing with simple issues. For example, Embit\u2019s miniscript/descriptor implementation is still incomplete, with many fragments not supported. We also experimented with Mako support, but decided to remove it because the project is not currently being maintained.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-5775-lightning-network-on-bitcoinfuzz-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5775-lightning-network-on-bitcoinfuzz-3\"></a>Lightning Network on Bitcoinfuzz</h2>\n<p>Differential fuzzing of Lightning implementations is proving to be highly valuable.. To advance this effort Erick Cestari and Morehouse have joined the project. Erick began working on it as a Vinteum fellow, mentored by Bruno and Morehouse, and more recently received a full grant from Vinteum. So far, bitcoinfuzz includes targets for BOLT11 invoice decoding and BOLT12 offer decoding.

It means that when we find any discrepancy, we can reference the spec to determine the correct behavior.

However, we have seen that differential fuzzing is also a good tool to improve the Lightning spec itself. From our experience, the specification is not always clear and often leaves room for improvement. As an example, one of the bitcoinfuzz trophies is a fix on the bolt12 specification, where a currency UTF-8 test vector lacked the required 3-byte length. As a result, many implementations were treating it as a case of malformed currency length instead of properly validating the UTF-8 encoding.</p>\n<p>Also, bitcoinfuzz found bugs in virtually every implementation we support.

This type of bug could have been easily caught by a basic fuzz target and a few minutes of execution.
