Sub 1 sat/vbyte transactions don't deserve to be in the pool with other transactions. A subpool should be possible if these transactions follow a different `maxmempool` and `mempoolexpiry`. *Example: 32 MB and 36 hours*\n2. If the subpool idea makes sense and does not introduce [free relay](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/free-relay/) then `minrelaytxfee` could be dropped to anything above zero.\n3. It does not make sense to leave the fee estimates unchanged if lower fee transactions are relayed and mined.\n\nIn the long term, mining pools will realize the [revenue](https://studio.glassnode.com/charts/fees.VolumeSum?a=BTC&mScl=log) will drop further with lower fee rates. It has only made new lows since 2017 (fees in BTC per day), price (in USD) is only ~5x since then and reward down from 12.5 BTC to 3.125 BTC.\n\nStill hopeful that [most blocks](https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/block-fee-rates#1w) will continue to have minimum fee rate above 1 sat/vbyte and users will prefer L2 for lower fees.",
