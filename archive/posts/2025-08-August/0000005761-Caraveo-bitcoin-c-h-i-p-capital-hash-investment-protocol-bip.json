  "cooked": "<p>This proposal introduces a revolutionary lending protocol that enables Bitcoin miners to leverage both their Bitcoin holdings and HASH power as collateral for business financing. The BITCOIN C.H.I.P (Capital Hash Investment Protocol) creates a native Bitcoin Capital market that maintains network security while providing miners with efficient access to capital for legitimate business operations.

This automated system reduces financial stress, lowers total interest costs, and optimizes cash flow by maintaining operational liquidity while systematically reducing debt.

This institutional integration provides enhanced liquidity, regulatory clarity, and sophisticated risk management while creating opportunities for public-private partnerships in mining infrastructure development. The protocol includes comprehensive business verification requirements, real-time collateral monitoring, and network protection mechanisms including a 5% maximum Bitcoin supply lending limit and 10% maximum HASH rate collateral limit. The dual collateral system creates unprecedented capital efficiency while maintaining network security, as HASH power collateral directly supports Bitcoin\u2019s security infrastructure.
