In particular, programs only have access to the transaction data and the UTXO data of the inputs, and execution only determines transaction validity (which lets the result of execution be cached). Let\u2019s say one starts with some set of basic operations that can perform various tasks such as basic computations, reading and/or processing data from the transaction, and signature verification. Each operation consumes some type of input (possibly empty) and returns some type of output. What are the ways we can combine these basic operations into more complex operations?</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-5647-sequential-composition-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5647-sequential-composition-3\"></a>Sequential Composition</h2>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"mermaid\"><code class=\"lang-mermaid\">graph LR\n    Input@{ shape: start } --&gt; f\n    g --&gt; Output@{ shape: stop }\n\n    subgraph Sequential Composition\n        direction LR\n        f --&gt; g \n    end    \n</code></pre>\n<p>The most fundamental composition method is sequential composition. If we have two basic operations, one whose output data type matches the input data type of the other, then we can combine these two operations into a new composite operation. This new operation runs these two basic operations in sequence, taking as input the input of the first operation, passing the output of that first operation into the input of the second operation, and ultimately returning the output of that second operation.</p>\n<p>Of course, we don\u2019t need to restrict ourselves to just combining basic operations. Now that we have some composite operations, we can combine those using functional composition as well.</p>\n<p>In mathematics, this sequential composition is often just called \u201ccomposition\u201d, and one might think that this is the only way of composing things. However, we have other ways of composing operations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-5647-parallel-composition-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5647-parallel-composition-4\"></a>Parallel Composition</h2>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"mermaid\"><code class=\"lang-mermaid\">graph LR\n    Input@{ shape: start } --- D@{ shape: anchor }\n    P@{ shape: circle, label: \"\u00d7\"} --&gt; Output@{ shape: stop }\n    subgraph Parallel Composition\n        direction LR\n        D --&gt; f\n        D --&gt; g\n        f --&gt; P\n        g --&gt; P\n    end\n</code></pre>\n<p>Suppose that we have two operations, they could be basic or complex operations, and they both take the same type of input. A second fundamental way of composing these two operations is to execute them both on the same input. This is called parallel composition, and the type of output is the \u201cproduct\u201d of the types of the outputs of the original operations and contains the pair of the two outputs.</p>\n<p>While this is called \u201cparallel\u201d composition, and the two operations could in principle be executed in parallel, parallel execution isn\u2019t an operational requirement. We can implement parallel composition \u201csequentially\u201d by executing one operation first and then the second operation.

The input to this composite operation is the \u201csum\u201d or \u201ctagged union\u201d of the types of the inputs of the original operation. In this instance the tag, \u201cLeft\u201d or \u201cRight\u201d, is a single bit in the input\u2019s data which determines which type of data is being carried, and hence which of the two operations can be executed.</p>\n<p>Conditional composition operates in the same way even when the input is the sum of two identical types. The sum type still contains a tag, and the value of that tag determines which of the two operations is to be executed.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-5647-composition-in-bitcoin-script-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5647-composition-in-bitcoin-script-6\"></a>Composition in Bitcoin Script</h1>\n<p>There are many ways of realizing these three kinds of composition in various programming languages.
