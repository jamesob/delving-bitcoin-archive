I think you would need to develop a set of tools(or Toolboxes) for writing/editing, debugging and deploying  the RGB compatible smart contracts as well as interacting with them in a safe secure way. Besides I think most likely killer applications for RGB-smart contracts would be securing complex multiparty contracts between hardware and software product vendors, infrastructure operators(like DePINs), end-users and managing Digital Twins of software-intensive hardware assets and components e.g. mobile devices, wearable computers, automobile parts and avionics components deployed on high performance blockchains such as OpBNB, TON and more efficient editions of Liquid.  Please share your thoughts. I would love to collaborate with you.</p>",
