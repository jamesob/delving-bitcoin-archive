Consider that custodial Bitcoin wallets are even worse, in that the offchain state is merely the trustmebro of the custodian; with Lightning and SuperScalar, the offchain state at least has the (unguaranteed) possibility of resolving with the onchain state if the LSP becomes uncooperative (unlike the case of custodial Bitcoin, where if the custodian refuses to cooperate, it can simply 0 out your account under you).  Custodial Bitcoin is significantly more broken than Lightning or similar schemes.  Until you can present a perfect scheme that allows Bitcoin to have offchain state perfectly resolved 100% of the time, I would respectfully ask you to point your attention at custodial schemes instead.  Improving something is still better than waiting for the perfect thing.  Sometimes you have to accept gray in a gray vs black fight.</p>",
