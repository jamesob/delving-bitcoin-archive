This writeup intends to summarize how Libbitcoin functions for someone familiar with Bitcoin Core\u2019s approach.

It will kick-off multiple asynchronous tasks (it uses <a href=\"https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_86_0/doc/html/boost_asio/overview/core/async.html\">Boost ASIO</a>). As you\u2019ll see later it\u2019s important as it enables it to take full advantage of its approach of splitting the various validation steps into checks which require strict, partial or no ordering.</p>\n<p>Libbitcoin\u2019s database is <em>conceptually</em> relational but the storage is abstracted out so different backends can be implemented. Conceptually the Libbitcoin node\u2019s database has a table for headers, transactions, transaction inputs and transaction outputs. It maintains an index from confirmation to header, header to transactions, transaction to header (only transactions confirmed in the best chain) and transaction output to its spending transaction.</p>\n<p>To sync, Libbitcoin will spin up a hundred (by default) connections (more on how it handles connections later) and will redundantly request headers from all its peers. Once it gets a chain of headers which is \u201ccurrent\u201d, as defined by being less than 1h older than the system time (by default), it will start querying blocks from its peers. Blocks queries are spread across all peers.</p>\n<p>Libbitcoin breaks down block validation into steps which need partial ordering and those that require strict ordering. Some checks (for instance block size, or transaction <code>nLockTime</code>) don\u2019t require any ordering. Checking scripts only require that you have seen the transactions that are being spent (partial ordering). Validating that the inputs actually exist requires that you went through all the blocks in order and checked the corresponding outputs were created and never spent (strict ordering). Libbitcoin will perform these checks, as well as the actual block downloading, concurrently.</p>\n<p>When a block is downloaded, checks which don\u2019t require ordering are performed and then the transactions are stored. Of course this is fine to do DoS-wise because it only considers transactions which are part of the chain with the most PoW. Concurrently the validation (see below for terminology) thread will perform for all new transactions the check which only require partial ordering. That is, all checks (including script) but whether inputs exist (and also relative timelocks, interestingly). The confirmability (see terminology below) thread will, still in parallel, check for a range of validated blocks whether all inputs spent by these transactions exist and are yet unspent. If they are it will for each transaction insert an entry in the transaction \u2192 header index, which conceptually \u201cmarks the block as confirmed\u201d. So the steps are 1) download 2) validation 3) confirmability but those happen concurrently for different ranges of blocks.</p>\n<p>Note that for blocks below the milestone (see below for terminology), Libbitcoin will skip transaction validation (besides checking they were properly committed, i.e. no malleation of either transactions or witnesses). This is in my opinion a similar threat model to Bitcoin Core\u2019s <code>-assumevalid</code>.</p>\n<p>Reorg\u2019ing is straightforward. To unconfirm a block the node just wipes the blocks\u2019 transactions from the transaction \u2192 header index.</p>\n<p>This means that pruning can technically be implemented by removing input and output data for historical spent outputs. In this case the node wouldn\u2019t be able to reorg past the pruning point without requesting peers for missing transactions.
