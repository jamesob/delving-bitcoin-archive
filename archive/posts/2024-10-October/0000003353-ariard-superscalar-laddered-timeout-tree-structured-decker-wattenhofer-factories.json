However,\nwith P2A, I realized that Decker-Wattenhofer was actually more viable \u2014\nand thus can be combined with timeout trees, creating the current\nSuperScalar. I then rushed to create a quick writeup, got it reviewed\ninternally, and got permission to publish it on Delving, so we could\npresent this at the summit. <a class=\"mention\" href=\"/u/moneyball\">@moneyball</a> believes it provides a possible\npath to wider Lightning onboarding, so this encouraged me to focus more\nattention on it and figuring out its flaws and limitations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re reading the mailing list, though the timeout trees concept was presented there.
