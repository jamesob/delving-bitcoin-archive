It appears that Torvalds himself sounds himself to have given him to put code of conduct in the kernel in 2018 (cf <a href=\"https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=8a104f8b5867c682d994ffa7a74093c54469c11f\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/9/16/167\">here</a>), under some blackmail pressures from SJW political activists.</p>\n<p>Personally, I\u2019ve nothing against political activism in itself, that\u2019s a basic right for the ones who are lucky to live in democracy respecting the rule of law.
