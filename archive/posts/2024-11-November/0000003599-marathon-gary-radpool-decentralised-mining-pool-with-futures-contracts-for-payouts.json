  "raw": "I enjoyed reading through the proposal and couldn't think of concrete reason it won't work.\n\nI have several questions and comments regarding the following:\n\n#### **Threshold Signature Schemes**\n\n* Was ROAST considered as an alternative to Lindell's scheme? How does the robustness/rounds of ROAST compare?\n\n#### **Data Handling and Transparency**\n  \n  * Recommendation: Implement time-decayed deletion of data for stratum jobs and shares. This incentivizes timely validation by miners and reduces storage costs for MSPs. Mining shares and jobs are incredibly data intensive.\n  * Protocol-level data availability: Defining or recommending a baseline for data availability ensures transparency while leaving implementation details to MSPs.\n\n**Miner Registration and Authentication:**\n  * Suggestion to replace \"registration\" with \"enrollment\" when discussing the relationship between miners and MSPs.\n  * The miner username should be unique across the network. \n   \n    How can uniqueness be accomplished? Using MSP pub key + mining username?\n  * Recommendation: specify desired authentication properties instead of specific username/password methods.\n\n**Syndicate Protocols for MSPs:**\n  * Misbehaving MSPs are removed from the syndicate and denied rewards.\n    \n    How exactly are dishonest MSPs identified and removed?\n  * MSP hash rate validation: If an MSP fails to provide valid hash rate within 2000 blocks, they are rejected. \n\n     Why is 2000 blocks the threshold?\n\n  * Syndicate's lack of visibility into miner-MSP contract rates:\n    \n    Does syndicate awareness of miner/MSP exchange rates break assumptions or security?\n\n**Scaling Threshold Signatures:**\n  * The syndicate must publish oracle signatures proportional to the number of miners. \n   \n    Could this scale become prohibitive?\n\n**Signed Coinbase:**\n  * Each MSP retains the signed coinbase until confirmed to a 100-block depth.
