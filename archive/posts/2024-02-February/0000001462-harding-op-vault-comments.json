For Bob to ensure he recovers the funds, he\u2019ll have to create a fairly large recovery transaction that pays a relatively high feerate to get confirmed in time.

Mallory obtains his trigger authorization key and creates (but does not broadcast) a zero-fee transaction that steals a relatively small amount of Bob\u2019s funds, revaulting the remaining amount.  Then Mallory creates another offchain spend from the revaulted output in another zero-fee transaction that steals a relatively small additional amount of Bob\u2019s funds.  Mallory repeats this process until she has roughly a block full of small-value spends from Bob\u2019s vault.  Mallory hasn\u2019t yet leaked any evidence that she knows Bob\u2019s trigger authorization key, so she patiently privately attempts to mine the block full of spends from Bob\u2019s vault during low feerate periods (she switches to mining a default Bitcoin Core template during high feerate periods).

This time she uses revaulting to split his total vault value into about 3,000 evenly-sized chunks (3,000 being my estimate of the maximum number of revaultings possible in a single block).  Each of these chunks may be economically viable for Bob\u2019s watchtower to recover, but to do so the watchtower\u2019s hot wallet must contain enough funds to pay for a spend of 3,000 inputs.  I quickly estimate the total input vsize of an authenticated recovery path at 100 vbytes, so even with maximal batching, Bob\u2019s watchtower will need to pay to put 300,000 vbytes onchain in a potentially short amount of time.  At 100 sats/vb, that implies paying 0.3 BTC in fees.  I think there are entirely plausible sets of circumstances that could lead to at least an order of magnitude higher feerates than that.</p>\n<p>If a watchtower may need to pay 0.3 BTC (or more), that implies a watchtower needs to keep 0.3 BTC in its hot wallet.  Any watchtower that fails to keep a sufficient amount will not be able to initiate a full recovery, allowing Mallory to successfully steal some of Bob\u2019s funds.  Someone who uses multiple fully capable watchtowers for redundancy and who assumes that, in the worst case, only one watchtower will be left standing at the time of an attempted theft will need to keep at least 0.3 BTC in every watchtower (e.g., for x watchtowers, they need a total of 0.3x BTC in watchtower hot wallets).
