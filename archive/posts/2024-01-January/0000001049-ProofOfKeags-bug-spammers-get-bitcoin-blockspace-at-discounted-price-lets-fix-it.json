You are making the claim that there is price \"discrimination\", as if the simple transactions are being targeted and as if their use case is more \"virtuous\" than others. The problem here is that witness bytes bear a different cost to the network than the main transaction bytes.\n\nWhat @sipa is saying is that fixing this would require reducing the witness discount. However, by reducing the witness discount you are also forcing more weight units to be consumed when those non-\"simple\" transactions are made. If you double the cost of those transactions, you would need the demand to reduce by >50% to actually allow for more \"simple\" transactions to be accepted in a block.\n\nThere is no bug here.
