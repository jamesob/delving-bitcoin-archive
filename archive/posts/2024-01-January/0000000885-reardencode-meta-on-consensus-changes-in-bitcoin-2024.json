I will try to briefly summarize some of the viewpoints, open the question of how consensus changes to bitcoin should be selected, and then provide my own thoughts on that question.\n\n## Ways to change consensus\n\n### Ossification\n\nOn the one hand, this perspective cannot be taken seriously, but it currently seems to hold sway with many in the bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nThis is the view that bitcoin consensus rules are fine as they are. It's perfect money already and does not require any improvements. There seem to be a few underlying reasons that some folks hold this view:\n\n* Inscription/ordinal derangement: Some folks hold the opinion that previous changes to bitcoin enabled inscriptions/ordinals and that changes are therefore bad.\n* General lack of understanding: For the non-technical, bitcoin seems to work by magic. Any change to a magical system could upset the delicate balance of magical properties that enable it.\n\n### Trusted Leaders\n\nThere seem to be a group of bitcoiners who will only consider a change to the bitcoin protocol if they are supported or proposed by the correct people. This view is essentially similar to the magical ossification view.
