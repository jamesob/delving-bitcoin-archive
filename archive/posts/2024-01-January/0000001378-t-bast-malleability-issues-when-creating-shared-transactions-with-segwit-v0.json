In most cases, participants pre-sign a refund transaction that can be used to get their funds back in case some of the other participants stop collaborating, to ensure their funds aren't locked forever in the contract. It is important that the `txid` of the shared transaction cannot be malleated, because the refund transaction would otherwise become useless, exposing users to blackmail to get their funds back.\n\nWe have this kind of usecase in lightning for interactive-tx transactions, used in dual-funding and splicing (https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/851).

This message contains a `prevtx` field that contains the transaction the participant is spending from. The question is thus: why is that necessary? Can't we simply transmit the corresponding `outpoint`, its `amount` and `scriptPubKey`?\n\nWe unfortunately can't, because that would let participants use non-segwit inputs, which allows them to malleate the `txid`. Let's look at it in more details. Alice and Bob want to collaboratively fund a lightning channel without transmitting the whole `prevtx` in their `tx_add_input` messages:\n\n1. Alice sends `tx_add_input` with `outpoint_A` and a p2wpkh `scriptPubKey`\n\n2. Bob sends `tx_add_input` with `outpoint_B` and a p2wpkh `scriptPubKey`\n\n3. Alice and Bob exchange signatures for the first commitment transaction spending that 2-inputs funding transaction\n\n4. Bob sends the witness data for his input of the funding transaction\n\n5. But Alice's input was actually using p2pkh instead of p2wpkh: she signs her input and publishes the funding transaction\n\nAt that point the published funding transaction has a different `txid` than the one that was used for the commitment transaction, since the p2pkh signature is included in the transaction hash. The commitment transactions are thus useless, and Bob's funds are stuck in a contract with Alice.

But it doesn't mean we can drop the `prevtx` in every case: participants are only protected **if they include one of their own segwit v1 input to the transaction**.
