It does not verify zero-knowledge proofs directly on Bitcoin (unless we have new opcodes it\u2019s just not possible). Instead it relies on a multi-party computation between nodes to manage a wallet, which tracks on-chain zkapps and their state (in the case they are stateful). The nice thing about the design is that MPC nodes don\u2019t need to know about the canonical chain, so they\u2019re really light to run, and could even easily run in trusted execution environment to provide some more defense-in-depth. We\u2019re looking for well-known ZK individuals to run nodes in order to maintain this service and have a large threshold parameter (the larger, the more nodes an attacker would need to compromise to compromise the L2). For now we\u2019re just running on testnet. As far as I know something like this didn\u2019t exist until today, so now you can use protocols like zkLogin or zkMail to lock your Bitcoin in zkapp and unlock them with a proof of login on Google or a proof that you received some email <img src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/uploads/default/original/1X/5aaddedce26377a1c157230f348187d7ba4d8e8f.gif\" alt=\"Smiley\" data-base62-sha1=\"cWbugZPJ3QDP63GwL2a9hWZe4HR\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\"></p>\n<p>You can check the CLI here: <a href=\"https://github.com/sigma0-xyz/zkbitcoin\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">GitHub - sigma0-xyz/zkbitcoin: zkBitcoin: zero-knowledge proofs on Bitcoin!</a></p>",
