That is data, it is not a payment (not a destination, not an amount). Same with submarine/coin swaps, often. Stupid example? Sure, but \u2026</p>\n<p>There are 3 reasons why this is acceptable:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It doesn\u2019t use excessive data</strong>. The size of the data fits into 40 bytes, so it is considered standard by ~all nodes</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>It doesn\u2019t cause high fees or bloat the utxoset</strong>. Shitcoin metaprotocols (such as brc20 and runes), in contrast, are guilty of damaging bitcoin in these ways.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Lightning is a bitcoin L2 and not an app</strong>, so we should treat it as more vital to bitcoin than an app. HTLC resolution transactions are required for the proper operation of Lightning, a unilateral-exit L2 that bitcoin cannot succeed without. We did 3 forks in order to enable Lightning; it deserves to be treated as a vital part of bitcoin at this point and not some sideshow. There are lots of other potential unilateral-exit L2s, like Ark, and these should also be considered bitcoin as such, and not applications, since they do not require trust in order to exit to L1.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Citrea uses excessive data (144 bytes for its watchtower challenge txs and apparently a lot of inscription data as well) and is not an L2 because it does not have unilateral exit (having opted instead for a 1-of-n trust model, so it should be considered an app, and not bitcoin as such). However, I don\u2019t expect Citrea watchtower challenge transactions to cause utxoset bloat or high fees (though the other data Citrea plans to post on-chain may do so).</p>\n<p>&gt;are you advocating against that if the data it puts on chain is not \u201cfinancial\u201d?</p>\n<p>No, I\u2019m saying that we should not be making extreme changes to bitcoin\u2019s social contract (that it should be used primarily for money; lifting the opreturn limit makes this much harder to achieve) to accommodate a non-unilateral-exit app. I don\u2019t care if people build these things as long as they fit within the arb data constraints and don\u2019t cause excessive fees or utxoset bloat.</p>\n<p>&gt;And because it\u2019s private, you don\u2019t know from the random 32 byte strings onchains, whether the activity was \u201cfinancial/payments\u201d or not?</p>\n<p>Well no, we don\u2019t need to know what the actual use case is; we only need to know whether that specific format is causing high-volume spam that drives high fees and/or utxoset bloat. That information is sufficient to both identify such transaction formats as spam and to detect and refuse to relay them.</p>\n<p>&gt;But why such a strong statement as \u201cdangerous to Bitcoin as money\u201d though? Because it isn\u2019t just wrong-headed to try to police transactions at the network layer, it\u2019s anathema to Bitcoin\u2019s central purpose.</p>\n<p>I disagree; bitcoin\u2019s central purpose is to be permissionless money. If we pivot to data storage, there is no way to avoid data storage becoming so dominant that it destroys the payment use case.</p>\n<p>&gt;If Bitcoin\u2019s p2p network is actively attacking Bitcoin (the protocol) itself (certainly not the case now because it\u2019s not homogeneous, and long may that last!</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not quite understanding this statement</p>\n<p>&gt;Including, yes, I think it\u2019s great that Knots, and others, exist as a plausible alternative) because it becomes a police force on what transactions are allowed</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t think it does. You are conflating spam filtration with censorship here. Censoring bitcoin is not possible because any miner with enough PoW to mine a block can confirm your transaction. You don\u2019t need the relay network to help you with this; you can simply submit your tx directly to a miner. This is the real mechanism that keeps bitcoin censorship resistant; the relay network has nothing to do with it.</p>\n<p>&gt;Well, that means it\u2019s also completely impractical to police them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s completely practical. I am happy with the 99% reduction in large opreturns the opreturn filter currently causes. A <em>100%</em> reduction is not practical; I completely agree. But that is not necessary.</p>\n<p>&gt;Are node runners going to get together every week and review the patterns of \u201cbad\u201d transactions that have been happening?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin/pull/119\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">I don\u2019t see why not</a>, if that\u2019s what it takes to make sure bitcoin stays money and doesn\u2019t become a general-purpose database that is impossible to use for money.
