This is unlike the MultiPTLC case where, after Ursula has gotten the MultiPTLC into the irrevocably committed state in the consistency protocol, Ursula can go offline and only the online LSPs need to keep being online and operating the \u201cstuckless but only because it was the original name\u201d payment protocol.</p>\n<p>We can do various magic math techniques to \u201callow\u201d Ursula to sod off and go offline, such as having different <code>deltaA</code> <code>deltaB</code> <code>deltaC</code> for each of Alice, Bob, and Carol.  But I should remind you that parts of the <code>delta</code> are outright revealed to remote forwarding nodes.  If a global surveillor exists, relying on <code>delta</code> to be secret to the LSPs means Ursula can end up paying more than just one unit of the payment it wanted to pay, because it is now possible for A B C to be part of the global surveillor and learning all of <code>deltaA</code> <code>deltaB</code> <code>deltaC</code> (if all the forwarding nodes that Ursula were unlucky enough to select are part of the global surveillor).  Thus, relying on separate <code>delta</code>s per LSP risks monetary loss if there is a global surveillor.  With a MultiPTLC instead, even if a global surveillor exists, all it learns is the proof-of-payment secret (and in the current HTLC world, every forwarding node learns the proof-of-payment anyway, so this is still an improvement) and Ursula has no risk of <em><strong>monetary loss</strong></em>, only risk of privacy loss, <em><strong>precisely because Ursula only locks one unit of payment before going offline, unlike with any other scheme where Ursula locks multiple units of the payment</strong></em>, where for full security Ursula needs to remain online to provide the receiver with a shard of the receiver-can-claim secret.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of other magic stuff I also thought about, and then shot down, because it is simply much better for Ursula to ever only lock one unit of payment in a single MultiPTLC than for Ursula to have multiple plain PTLCs of which only exactly one is acceptable to be claimed.  I mean, a MultiPTLC is literally just a PTLC with multiple P branches and one TL branch, it is <em><strong>not</strong></em> that complicated.  I just do not know enough about the math involved if you can do something like just have multiple Taproot branches (which is why I proposed multiple alternate transactions that terminate at a plain PTLC, because that is what I am sure will work) but if that is possible than that simplifies things (I am <em><strong>not a mathist</strong></em>, I only portray one on the interwebz).

Then, their wallet shows \u201c-1000 sats\u201d.  When Ursula comes back later, it just asks any of the LSPs for how the payment went.
