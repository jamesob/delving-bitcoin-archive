I had to come to terms with this recently myself when trying to imagine a set of consensus rules that would always be able to reject data spam as invalid while always allowing payment use cases as valid. We agree 100% here. This is precisely the reason I am not advocating for a consensus change; since it is <a href=\"https://blog.bitmex.com/the-unstoppable-jpg-in-private-keys/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">not even theoretically possible</a> to detect and filter all data use cases, attempting to formalize such things is a fool\u2019s errand.</p>\n<p>The fact that spam is not something that can be formally defined is precisely the reason why such things can only be countered at the social/mempool layer rather than the consensus layer, and it is precisely the reason why the protective bitcoin maximalist culture [and the filters its proponents run] will always be vital to bitcoin\u2019s survival and success.</p>\n<p><em>However</em>, it is <em>not</em> the case that, since spam cannot be formally specified, we necessarily need to give up all efforts to bias payments over data. Yes, there is a large gray area as I\u2019ve already acknowledged; but there are also transaction formats that are <em>only</em> abused for data. BRC-20 is the worst offender here, and, again, it is trivially easy to identify. It <em>objectively, permanently</em> harmed bitcoin and thus is <em>objectively spam and should be discouraged</em>.</p>\n<p>There is no <em>general</em> formula for spam, but we know <em>100% without a doubt</em> that BRC-20 <em>specifically</em> is spam, and it is very likely that all inscriptions are spam, especially those that violate the datacarriersize setting (80 bytes on a majority of nodes).</p>\n<p>&gt;So I think your position that we can police usage is only fully compatible with fixed format, public and unscalable payments on the base layer (and tbh, imo, not even compatible with that!).</p>\n<p>I am not following your train of reasoning to this conclusion. I am not saying that we can make a general filter that has no false positives; I am saying we can filter specific formats we *know* are data spam. Mempool filters are the ideal mechanism for this as they can adapt quickly to counter evolving spam threats.</p>\n<p>&gt;Our inability to bias is a feature, not a bug.</p>\n<p>No such \u201cinability\u201d exists. See again the <a href=\"https://x.com/oomahq/status/1931856202511888465\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">99% decrease in large opreturns</a> the opreturn filter causes. We have been biasing bitcoin towards payments since the days of Satoshi, and we should continue doing so for as long as we can.</p>\n<p>&gt;In fact it might be the main reason Bitcoin still exists 16+ years after inception.</p>\n<p>I disagree. Yes, censorship resistance is a primary reason bitcoin has been successful, but plenty of shitcoins are \u201ccensorship resistant\u201d too, and yet they are not money. Censorship resistance is necessary, but not sufficient, for bitcoin to be successful in the long run. We must also make sure that data use cases are de-prioritized as much as we can. It is bitcoin\u2019s maximalist culture and its hostility to scammy/spammy use cases (as well as its censorship-resistant architecture) that has led to bitcoin\u2019s success.</p>\n<p>Again, Ethereum is just as \u201ccensorship resistant\u201d as bitcoin, and yet it is not as successful and cannot make as strong a claim to being \u201cmoney\u201d as bitcoin. The difference between Ethereum and bitcoin is this \u201cbias\u201d towards good money, and this bias is a <em>cultural</em> (rather than <em>consensus</em>) phenomenon because <em>it has to be</em>, for the reasons outlined above.</p>\n<p>If we break with 16 years of precedent and remove this bias, there is <em>nothing</em> stopping bitcoin from becoming [something very much like] Ethereum, full stop.

But hey, obviously it\u2019s nuanced.</p>\n<p>Yes, it\u2019s definitely nuanced. I think this conflict is likely never to resolve to anyone\u2019s satisfaction, because the flipside of attempting to prevent users from submitting certain transactions is attempting to prevent users from deciding which transactions they are able to refuse to announce to their peers, which is arguably a matter of free speech and the right to remain silent. I\u2019m sure you would agree that forcing someone to say something against their will is bad; it could be considered compelled speech.
