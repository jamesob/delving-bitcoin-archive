It is great to see more research going into the impact of network level attacks on Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>I am dropping a few unordered thoughts here, feel free to ignore any of them if they are not useful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eclipse attacks: The goal of the attacker is to control all incoming and outgoing connections to a node. This allows the attacker to waste mining power, do selfish mining, double spend, attack Lightning, etc [<a href=\"https://ihchoi12.github.io/assets/tran2020stealthier.pdf\">1</a>]. This was previously done by polluting AddrMan\u2019s tables with IPs that the attacker controlled [<a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-heilman.pdf\">2</a>], or was on the path to [<a href=\"https://ihchoi12.github.io/assets/tran2020stealthier.pdf\">1</a>]. Core has mitigated these eclipsing methods by making changes to AddrMan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IMO it should be noted for completeness that usage of BIP324 and StratumV2 is limiting the damage that an attacker can do if these attacks are explicitly named. Also I think the impact of alternative connection types like Tor or I2P would be interesting to evaluate. Having multiple tor peers may actually make the attack easier if the entry guard is being used consistently through out the attack. On the other hand, if there is one tor connection and multiple entry guards are used or rotated frequently then it makes it harder again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Compromise or set up a new AS as close (in number of AS hops) to the victim node AS as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s not clear to me from the write-up if this is the same AS that is mentioned in the requirements or if this is a second one. I guess 1. is just the classic way of trying to evict and starting from 2. this is what you suggest as a new style of attack. I think the description could be a bit clearer to make clear if both of these styles need to be used or if that is not the case maybe mention the classic style rather as a footnote.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sort IP prefixes by number of nodes and hijack them in succession at a rate that will not raise alarms.</p>\n<p>Hijack rate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am not a network engineer and I don\u2019t know what detection mechanisms there might be triggered but I would expect that being much more aggressive should yield higher success probability. Doing the attack as fast as possible should raise the success probability significantly since there is less other interference happening (node changing connections, new routes being made available etc.). In your numbers you assume the absolute worst case scenario (hijacking all prefixes), I think that can be more optimistic. A well organized attacker might do some probing without hijacking first, just using the bitcoin network, to make more informed choices about which prefixes to attack.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We find that the attacker can always successfully hijack 41.13% of node prefixes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I find that a bit too strongly worded given that there are often additional filters in place that could prevent the shorter prefix from being successful.
