Is everything above correct?\n2. Is it possible that **ACINQ node** will deny to open a channel with me? For instance, for AML reasons\n3. Could interim nodes do the same when **P0** is negotiated? And do they on practice? e.g. **N1** thinks that **N2** has high AML risk and evades to participate in routing\n4. Does sender enforce its routing path **P0** (mandatory) or **N1** can on its own choose a channel to route **Alice**\u2019s payment from **ACINQ,** i.e. **N123** instead of **N2**? How technically these things are done? Couldn\u2019t google anything easy to understand on routing algo but read that **Alice** / **ACINQ** do know(!) the full route, same as in Tor onion layering\n5. What exactly the capacity term means in LN, i.e. **ACINQ** has \\~424 BTC capacity - is it a sum of all opened channels? How can I evaluate it to something more practically meaningful, e.g. here capacity of \\~424 BTC means sending 50 BTC has a chance of 30% to find a route to **Bob** who is connected only to **Binance** node. What is inbound / outbound efficiency?\n6. Why some huge nodes are marked as hard to reach despite them being top 5 capacity? i.e. nicehash and Kraken nodes on https://terminal.lightning.engineering/ why is that? Nicehash has the channel with okx, so it should be basically reachable from everywhere\n7. If **Alice** entry channel to LN has e.g. 0.1 BTC capacity and **Bob** has a channel of 50 BTC will it be possible to send 50 BTC to **Bob** in practice? Capacity of 50 BTC doesn\u2019t guarantee that there will be a route summing up exactly to 50 BTC.
