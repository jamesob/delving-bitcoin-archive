However, for the general case where <em>any</em> participant may unilaterally exit <em>any</em> of the offchain UTXOs it has, the best seems to be the use of Merkle trees, which require O(log N) data to be published onchain to exit a single offchain UTXO.</p>\n<p>As a concrete example, <code>OP_CTV</code>-trees can be created to allow unilateral exit of some offchain UTXO by publishing the tree path from the root to the specific offchain UTXO being published.</p>\n<p>Of note is that an entire Merkle tree with N leaves has a total data size O(N log N).  If the probability that <em><strong>all</strong></em> N offchain UTXOs will end up having to exit is high, then producing the entire tree requires O(N log N) data, whereas a simple single-input multi-output transaction would be O(N), which is one of the objections to <code>OP_CTV</code>-trees and mechanisms based on it.

To insert into the Merkle tree, you generate a new path to a new leaf, and the witness is the Merkle tree path to the new leaf (which is sufficient to prove that the leaf exists in the tree).  Existing witnesses need to be modified as well, but the Merkle tree path to the new leaf is sufficient to modify the Merkle tree paths of the other leaves.   Removal means taking the Merkle tree path and removing the leaf, and recomputing the Merkle tree root hash (and again, modifying the Merkle tree paths of other non-removed leaves).  The issue with Merkle trees is that the witness (Merkle tree path) is \u201cshort\u201d in the sense of requiring only O(log N), but it is not \u201cshort\u201d in the sense of requiring only O(1).</p>\n<p>RSA-based accumulators also exist.  The RSA assumption is that: it is easy to verify if a number is divislble by a partricular prime number, but difficult to actually factor a number to all its prime number factors.  A simple RSA accumulator would have items be (or be represented by) prime numbers, and the accumulator itself would simply be the product of all the prime number members.  To prove membership, show the item (a prime number) and try to divide the accumulator (total product) by it and see if it is divisible.  Insertion is multiplication and removal is division.  This has O(1) witness, but the accumulator itself is O(N) \u2014 the representation of a product generally requires a number of bits equal to the sum of the bits representing its factors.  Thus, if we are using Bitcoin and fixed-size <code>scriptPubKey</code> we would feel obligated to hash the accumulator to a fixed-size hash, and revealing the accumulator would be O(N) data, meaning in effect that the witness is O(N).  There are RSA-based schemes which have the accumulator itself be O(1), which I am studying right now, but those frikkin mathists like 1-character variable names too much, often with characters being in a different font being different things, which is crazy, like this is the first thing programmers get taught, do not use single-character variable names, what is wrong with mathists???</p>\n<p>Another observation we can make is that Taproot script alternatives are really a use of Merkle tree accumulators.  <em><strong>If</strong></em> a nice accumulator with O(1) accumulator and O(1) witness actually existed, whose constant factors and validation times were acceptable, <em>then</em> we should have modified Taproot to use that accumulator instead of Merkle tree accumulators.  Since we did not, and Taproot uses Merkle trees, I hereby conclude that there currently exists <strong>no</strong> accumulator with O(1) accumulator size and O(1) witness with acceptable constant factors and validation times.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"op_exit-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#op_exit-3\"></a><code>OP_EXIT</code></h1>\n<p>Let us assume that we have some kind of accumulator scheme.

The \"witness\" is \"\"succinct\", i.e. \"short\" for some definition of \"short\".\n  * Removal of items requires the \"witness\" constructed from insertion, and creates a new version of the accumulator.\n  * In most accumulators, insertion and removal will require that existing witnesses already issued be modified as well, but the revelation of the witness of the insertion / removal is sufficient to modify the existing witnesses.\n* It is possible for a third party to get an accumulator and a witness, and be convinced that the item was inserted and not yet removed from that version of the accumulator (i.e. proof of set membership).\n\nThe concept of \"cryptographic accumulator\" is an abstraction and is not a specific thing.  In cryptography, any number of schemes may match it (with various caveats like \"with high probability\" etc.).\n\nGenerally, Merkle trees are considered a form of cryptographic accumulator.  To insert into the Merkle tree, you generate a new path to a new leaf, and the witness is the Merkle tree path to the new leaf (which is sufficient to prove that the leaf exists in the tree).  Existing witnesses need to be modified as well, but the Merkle tree path to the new leaf is sufficient to modify the Merkle tree paths of the other leaves.   Removal means taking the Merkle tree path and removing the leaf, and recomputing the Merkle tree root hash (and again, modifying the Merkle tree paths of other non-removed leaves).  The issue with Merkle trees is that the witness (Merkle tree path) is \"short\" in the sense of requiring only O(log N), but it is not \"short\" in the sense of requiring only O(1).\n\nRSA-based accumulators also exist.  The RSA assumption is that: it is easy to verify if a number is divislble by a partricular prime number, but difficult to actually factor a number to all its prime number factors.  A simple RSA accumulator would have items be (or be represented by) prime numbers, and the accumulator itself would simply be the product of all the prime number members.  To prove membership, show the item (a prime number) and try to divide the accumulator (total product) by it and see if it is divisible.  Insertion is multiplication and removal is division.  This has O(1) witness, but the accumulator itself is O(N) --- the representation of a product generally requires a number of bits equal to the sum of the bits representing its factors.  Thus, if we are using Bitcoin and fixed-size `scriptPubKey` we would feel obligated to hash the accumulator to a fixed-size hash, and revealing the accumulator would be O(N) data, meaning in effect that the witness is O(N).

Since we did not, and Taproot uses Merkle trees, I hereby conclude that there currently exists **no** accumulator with O(1) accumulator size and O(1) witness with acceptable constant factors and validation times.\n\n`OP_EXIT`\n========\n\nLet us assume that we have some kind of accumulator scheme. This can be any accumulator scheme with the desired properties of O(1) accumulator size, O(1) witness size, and nice constant factors and validation times.  Or it could just be Merkle trees if we cannot find anything better.\n\nNow, suppose there are N different participants sharing a single UTXO.  These N participants have N funds inside the UTXO, i.e. they are offchain UTXOs that can be made real on unilateral exit, or kept in the shared UTXO where some other mechanism (Decker-Wattenhofer decrementing `nSequence`, or timebound Spilman sets a la timeout-trees, Decker-Russell-Osuntokun) can be used to cut through transfers between participants within the same shared UTXO.\n\nWe start with some \"empty\" accumulator, then insert a commitment to pairs `(point, value)`, where `point` is a standard SECP256K1 denoting the (possibly MuSig or FROST-composed) owner of a particular number of satoshis, with `value` being that number of satoshis.
