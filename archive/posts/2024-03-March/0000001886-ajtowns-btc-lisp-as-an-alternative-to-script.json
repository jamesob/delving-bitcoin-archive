It maintains the bottom-up theme, so again, if this doesn\u2019t strike you as innately interesting, maybe just remember that this topic exists so you can refer back to it later as useful background material when we do finally get to something interesting.</p>\n<div data-theme-toc=\"true\"> </div>\n<h2><a name=\"background-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#background-1\"></a>Background</h2>\n<p>So on and off over the past couple of years I\u2019ve been poking at what it might look like to have some form of lisp available as an alternative to script, mostly in the form of hackish python code that I call <a href=\"https://github.com/ajtowns/lisp-play/blob/916d22c7bc322f66abed361e96e6e991a597173a/btclisp.py\">btclisp.py</a>. It\u2019s mostly designed as a learning tool for me, the idea being to help me figure out answers to questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What sort of features are possible if you had Lisp as a transaction language?</li>\n<li>Do the ideas that seem fine in theory turn out to work or fail when you try them in practice?</li>\n<li>How annoying is it to implement/maintain/upgrade a Lisp interpreter?</li>\n<li>How annoying is it to write code in Lisp?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It might be useful context to know that while I\u2019m familiar with functional programming (having dabbled in haskell, hope, coq, lean4), I\u2019ve never done anything with lisp before (not even emacs lisp). My main sources of inspiration here are Daniel Holden\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/\">Build Your Own Lisp</a> and, as mentioned, Chia Lisp.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"scope-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#scope-2\"></a>Scope</h2>\n<p>My idea here is fairly simple: what if we made a Lisp that was a drop-in replacement for <a href=\"https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/b3701faef2bdb98a0d7ace4eedbeefa2da4c89ed/bip-0342.mediawiki\">BIP 342 tapscript</a>? That is, introduce a new tapleaf version, so that when that\u2019s used, the taproot script is decoded into a lisp expression, the remaining witness data is stuffed into the environment, and the lisp expression is evaluated, with the result that the transaction is invalid if the evaluation fails, and is valid otherwise.</p>\n<p>Some things are out of scope, eg:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing the UTXO database \u2013 Chia\u2019s coin set model has different information in its database compared to Bitcoins UTXO set model, which allows for some clever structures. We\u2019re not considering that here, since it requires changing the UTXO database, and that is a much more significant change than adding a new tapleaf version.</li>\n<li>Having scripts interact \u2013 various features of Chia\u2019s model allows scripts to interact: conditions allow a script to require that some other script in the same block created or spent a coin; spend bundles allow scripts from different coins to potentially be combined and duplicated; signature aggregation allows signatuers to be, uh, aggregated; and the <a href=\"https://docs.chia.net/block-format/\"><code>transactions_generator_ref_list</code></a> feature even lets you pull in historical scripts from earlier blocks so you can cheaply reuse code or data from those scripts. All of that is also out of scope.</li>\n<li>Changing how a tx is treated as a result of the program \u2013 Chia\u2019s scripts are often only the first step in validation: eg, in Chia you don\u2019t know how much \u201cspace\u201d a transaction will take up in the block until you evaluate the script, as calculating the cost is a side effect of evaluating the script, and the result of evaluating a script in chia is a set of constraints that also need to be fulfilled by the block. The aim here is not to do that, so that running the script only results in a boolean result, ie \u201cvalid\u201d or \u201cinvalid\u201d, and any other information (such as weight/cost, timelocks, relationships with other txs) should be available prior to script evaluation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of this is to say that those ideas are necessarily bad, though: just that I\u2019m treating them as out of scope here. That is, this is just about exploring the possibility of using lisp as a tapscript alternative, not more complex changes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"summary-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#summary-3\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>As you might expect, I ended up repeating most of the same design decisions that resulted in Chia lisp, so I\u2019m only going to describe the differences here.

This gives about 45 opcodes total, though not all of them are implemented in btclisp.py at all, and some that are are implemented incorrectly \u2013 it\u2019s a learning tool after all: the reader needs some exercises!</p>\n<p>Some details on some of the above:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"quoting-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#quoting-5\"></a>Quoting</h3>\n<p>Actually, one thing I\u2019ll note first: my expression parser allows abbreviating <code>(q . x)</code> as <code>'x</code>. No big deal, but it makes things easier to write, so I\u2019ll make use of that abbreviation below.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"environment-trees-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#environment-trees-6\"></a>Environment trees</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbZ8zDpX2Mg\">Chia-style environment structuring</a> is pretty neat, but it\u2019s more optimal if your environment is structured as a binary tree, rather than a list \u2013 with a list, each element is put in position 2, 5, 11, 23, 47, 95, etc, with each subsequent position being <span class=\"math\">p_{n+1} = 2p_n+1</span>, effectively doubling the value each time. But if done with a small binary tree instead, you only need values up to <span class=\"math\">2n</span> (well, <span class=\"math\">2^{\\lceil \\log_2(2n) \\rceil}</span>), so 6 elements could be instead encoded as 8, 12, 10, 14, 5, 7. Whether that really matters is debatable, however at some point serializing a reference to a larger number becomes less efficient that a smaller number would be, so optimisation here has some potential to be useful.</p>\n<p>In any event, I implemented this behaviour for the ENV\u2026 parameters in the <code>a</code> opcode, and via the <code>b</code> opcode: in both cases, if you provide those operators 4 arguments, they\u2019ll convert that list into a balanced tree of conses, going from <code>(a b c d)</code> to <code>((a . b) . (c . d))</code>. If the <code>sf</code> opcode were implemented, the same behaviour would apply there too.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"ecc-calculations-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#ecc-calculations-7\"></a>ECC calculations</h3>\n<p>The <code>secp256k1_muladd</code> opcode allows doing ECC operations by hand to some degree, in particular it allows making assertions along the lines of <code>a*P + b*Q = c*R</code> where <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code> are scalars, and <code>P</code>, <code>Q</code>, <code>R</code> are points on the secp256k1 curve. There are a few tricks to the encoding for this operation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>if an argument is an atom, it\u2019s treated as expressing a scalar multiple of the generator, ie <code>a*G</code></li>\n<li>if the argument is a cons, the head part is treated as the scalar, and the tail part as the point, ie <code>h*T</code>; the point can either be a normal 33-byte point, or a 32-byte x-only point</li>\n<li>if the head part of the cons is nil, the scalar is treated as -1</li>\n<li>if the tail part of the cons is nil, the point is treated as <code>-G</code></li>\n<li>rather than treat one of the arguments as being alone on its side of the equal signs, we actually evaluate <code>a*P + b*Q + c*R = 0</code> (where 0 is the point at infinity)</li>\n<li>scalars are treated as big-endian numbers (matching the treatment in BIP 340), which diverges from the little-endian approach elsewhere here</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The BIP 340 verification equation (<code>s*G = R + h*P</code>) can thus be expressed as <code>(secp256k1_muladd (s . nil) (1 . R) (h . P))</code>. This allows writing <code>bip340_verify</code> directly, something like:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"lisp\"><code class=\"lang-lisp\">(a '(secp256k1_muladd \n       (c '1 4) \n       (c (sha256 5 4 7 (bip342_txmsg)) 7)\n       (c 6 nil)\n     )\n    (substr 3 0 '32)\n    (substr 3 '32 '64)\n    (a '(cat 1 1) (sha256 '\"BIP0340/challenge\"))\n    2\n)`\n</code></pre>\n<p>assuming the initial environment is <code>(key . sig)</code>.</p>\n<p>I think that serves as an example of how you could use the building blocks provided by a reasonably powerful language with reasonably generic opcodes in order to experiment with new functionality, in this case getting the functionality of BIP 340, without having to first get the logic implemented in C++ and merged into bitcoin core, eg.</p>\n<p>(For example, being able to implement BIP 340 Schnorr signature verification by hand, means you have the option of tweaking the construction to make different design choices than BIP 340 did, eg to allow signatures to not commit to their own signing key.)</p>\n<h3><a name=\"transaction-introspection-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#transaction-introspection-8\"></a>Transaction Introspection</h3>\n<p>Almost any interesting new functionality is going to require some logic based on the transaction \u2013 so if we want to make experimenting with ideas like <code>SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT</code> or <code>OP_CSV</code> possible without having to implement them in C++ first, then you need something that pulls out information about the transaction being validated. This is what the <code>tx</code> op is all about. It\u2019s very straightforward: you give it a list of arguments that tell it what bits of information about the tx you want, and it gives you all that information back. (Except, if you only want one piece of information, it won\u2019t wrap that in a list, to save you a call to <code>h</code>)</p>\n<p>The bits of information currently supported are:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>number</th>\n<th>level</th>\n<th>description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>nVersion</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>nLockTime</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>number of inputs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>number of outputs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>index of input for this script</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>full tx without witness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>tapleaf hash for the current script</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>taproot internal public key for this input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>taproot merkle path to this script for this input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>tx</td>\n<td>(missing) taproot parity bit, leaf version, script for this input</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>input</td>\n<td>nSequence</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>input</td>\n<td>prevout hash</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>input</td>\n<td>prevout index</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>input</td>\n<td>scriptSig</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>input</td>\n<td>annex (nil if not present, annex including 0x50 prefix if present)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>input</td>\n<td>coin being spent\u2019s nValue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>input</td>\n<td>coin being spent\u2019s scriptPubKey</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n<td></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>output</td>\n<td>nValue</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td>output</td>\n<td>scriptPubKey</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>The idea here is that if you just specify the number, eg <code>(tx 5 13 20)</code> you\u2019ll get the corresponding data for the current input, or the output with the same index as the current input, and if you want to investigate a different input/output, you use a cons pair to specify the number and the input/output that you\u2019re interested in, eg: <code>(tx (10 . 0) (20 . 0))</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that for other inputs, only the scriptSig and annex are made available, not the entire witness stack; the idea being twofold: first, that the witness stack for other inputs may depend on future soft forks, and not be something you can analyse meaningfully, and second, that we could reasonably aim to keep the annex small, so that analysing other inputs\u2019 annexes is a quick and cheap operation, while their witness data may be large, causing analysis of it to be slow and expensive.</p>\n<p>This does not currently define a format for putting data in the annex, and hence does not provide functionality for pulling snippets of data out of the annex.

I went with the easy approach and just said \u201cmath operators treat their inputs as 64-bit unsigned little-endian numbers, truncating if necessary\u201d. My guess is that having arbitrary size little-endian numbers with the highest bit acting as a sign bit (matching CScriptNum behaviour) is probably more sensible though.</p>\n<p>Adding a <code>strrev</code> function would allow easily swapping a positive number to it\u2019s big-endian representation, which would then make it possible to calculate scalars for use with <code>secp256k1_muladd</code>, which may be useful.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"serialization-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#serialization-10\"></a>Serialization</h2>\n<p>While Chia\u2019s serialization format is admirably simple, I thought it would make sense to have one that was more optimised for the use case. In that vein, I figured the following things were likely to be frequent and that it might be worth minimising the overhead for them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>nil</li>\n<li>small numbers (for opcodes and environment references, eg 0x01 to 0x2f)</li>\n<li>small atoms (strings of up to 64 bytes so that we can include bip340 signatures, eg)</li>\n<li>small lists (eg, lists with one through five elements plus the terminator)</li>\n<li>nil-terminated lists (ie, mark lists as proper or improper, so that a nil terminator is implied)</li>\n<li>quoted elements</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So I picked the following encoding:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>byte value</th>\n<th>meaning</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>0x00</td>\n<td>nil</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0x01 - 0x33</td>\n<td>one byte atom with value 0x01 to 0x33</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0x34</td>\n<td>leftover atoms: if the next byte is 0x00 or 0x34 to 0xFF, then it is that single byte atom, if the next byte is 0x01 to 0x33 (s), then a multibyte atom of length 64+1 to 64+33 bytes follows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0x35 - 0x73</td>\n<td>multibyte atom of length 2 to 64 bytes follows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0x74</td>\n<td>read a length value (0-inf), a multibyte atom of length 64+33+1+(0 to inf) bytes follows</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0x75 - 0x79</td>\n<td>a nil-terminated list of 1 to 5 entries, those entries follow immediately</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0x7a - 0x7e</td>\n<td>an improper list of 2 to 6 entries, those entries follow immediately (the last one being the terminator)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0x7f</td>\n<td>a list of more than five entries; first read the size and whether the list is nil-terinated, then the entries in the list follow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0x80 - 0xff</td>\n<td>the same as 0x00 to 0x7f, except quoted</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>With this encoding, the programs above to verify a schnorr signature and to calculate the BIP 342 sighash serialise to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>7f0001f82a7705810477057924050407752c0777050600780f0300a0780f03a0b4407701f71001017624c4424950303334302f6368616c6c656e676502</code> (61 bytes)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>7701f901ff00240404b40006037624bd546170536967686173687f0610b400762b80762b8176247f01010101f710762b77058b01762b77058c0180762b828076247f01010101f62b77058f0180762b828076247f01010101f701f710760e0101762bf51080762b828076247f01010101f62b77058a0180762b828076247f01010101f710762b770594017701f710760e0101762b7705950180762b83807803762b8e8381780f7710762b84b70000000080847803762b8e76247701f710760e0101762b8e807810762b86b400b7fffffffff60178030eff010108080c77170a8177180e8177100377010c0a83</code> (236 bytes)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Certainly preferable to use a built-in one byte opcode when it\u2019s available, but if there isn\u2019t an opcode that does exactly what you want and the only alternative is waiting for a consensus change to be developed, supported, merged, deployed and activated, then costing about the same as a 2-of-3 multisig seems pretty good. If you\u2019re not trying to match an existing spec, then some more bytes can be shaved off by designing your hash to match what\u2019s easily expressible with the provided opcodes, too \u2013 eg, just grab the data you want via <code>(tx ...)</code>, then serialize it with <code>(wr (tx ...))</code> then take the hash of that <code>(sha256 (wr (tx ..)))</code>, and things should be both easier and cheaper, without losing any expressivity or security.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"costing-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#costing-11\"></a>Costing</h2>\n<p>The above assumes that the witness size in bytes is the important thing to worry about when working out the cost of a script. That\u2019s true today, but it isn\u2019t true with any language that allows looping: with the ability to do iteration or recursion, a program that takes only a few bytes to write down, can take a large amount of time or memory to actually conclude.</p>\n<p>I think there\u2019s three fundamental things to worry about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the size of the program \u2013 this has to be revealed on the blockchain, so takes up bandwidth and space accordingly</li>\n<li>the amount of time/compute needed to run the program \u2013 all the programs in a block should complete within a few seconds; so any individual program should take up time proportional to how much of the block weight limit it uses up</li>\n<li>the amount of memory needed to run the program \u2013 currently, script programs are limited to operating on about 500kB of data on the stack (including the altstack), while that could be expanded, maintaining a small fixed limit is probably wise</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I included a rough sketch of how those limits might be monitored (<code>ALLOCATOR.limit</code> sets a global allocation limit to track the memory usage being used, and <code>ALLOCATOR.effort_limit</code> nominally tracks the total computation resources, assuming calls to <code>ALLOCATOR.record_work(x)</code> are made when computation is done), but haven\u2019t actually set the costs of various functionality in any meaningful way. Really, I figure that we\u2019d need to do a realistic implementation of all the opcodes in C++, then benchmark them to produce realistic costs, then work backwards from that to set the overall computation limit per block.</p>\n<p>Note that costing current memory usage implies defining a \u201cconsensus-preferred\u201d way of evaluating the program: eager vs lazy evaluation, tail call elimination, and order of evaluation can all require different amounts of memory to each other for different programs, and because exceeding the memory usage limit would render a transaction invalid, consistently and accurately accounting for that limit is consensus critical in this model. That doesn\u2019t mean optimisation can\u2019t be done, though, it just means that the costing/limit checking is an additional result of evaluation, and it must not be changed as a result of any optimisations.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"midstates-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#midstates-12\"></a>Midstates</h2>\n<p>One of the interesting things Liquid/Elements did <a href=\"https://blog.blockstream.com/tapscript-new-opcodes-reduced-limits-and-covenants/\">a little while ago now</a> was to add \u201cstreaming hash opcodes\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We added \u201cstreaming hash\u201d opcodes to allow feeding data into a hash engine without needing to put it all into a single stack element. This cleanly avoids the 520-byte stack element limit without requiring any more resource usage from the script interpreter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These took the form of <code>OP_SHA256INITIALIZE</code> (takes a string, generates a midstate), <code>OP_SHA256UPDATE</code> (takes a midstate and string, generates a midstate), <code>OP_SHA256FINALIZE</code> (takes a midstate and string, generates the final hash). So instead of <code>A B C CAT CAT SHA256</code> you might have <code>A SHA256INIT B SHA256UPDATE C SHA256FINALIZE</code>.</p>\n<p>The direct consequence of this, that you can generate a hash from a sequence of small pieces of data without having to combine them first, isn\u2019t interesting here, as we can simply provide the same sequence of small pieces of data as arguments to the <code>(sha256 ...)</code> opcode, and achieve the same result.</p>\n<p>That\u2019s fine as far as it goes, but when you consider making the underlying scripting language more powerful, it\u2019s worth considering how that changes things. So there are effectively two important differences:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Interleaving calculation of the input values to the hash function and calls to update</li>\n<li>Reusing inputs across different hash functions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For an example of the first issue, suppose (as a programming exercise) you wanted to calculate the sha256 of the concatenation of the first 2000 fibonacci numbers. With Chia\u2019s model, namely having a multi-argument sha256 opcode and eager evaluation, this would require first calculating the 2000 fibonacci numbers, then running sha256 over them, requiring about 174kB of memory to store binary representations for all those numbers, rather than calculating them, feeding them to the hash function, then discarding them as the next number is calculated.</p>\n<p>An approach that solves that problem is lazy evaluation: you construct a program that generates the list of <code>(sha256 1 1 2 3 5 ...)</code> for your 2000 fibonacci numbers, then you call <code>a</code> on it. Because the evaluation happens lazily, nothing is calculated until the sha256 opcode actually needs its next argument, and the simplest way of writing the program automatically becomes relatively efficient.</p>\n<p>However the second challenge can\u2019t be resolved by leaving it up to the interpreter \u2013 working out when to interleave calculations might be possible to automate, but certainly seems to complex to add as a consensus feature.</p>\n<p>A possible generic approach to making that feature available might be adding a \u201cpartial application\u201d opcode, so that writing <code>(partial sha256 a b c)</code> returns a special \u201cfunction\u201d object that encapsulates the midstate of having hashed <code>a b c</code> without any finalisation. That object could then be passed to <code>a</code> to finish the operation, or could be passed to another <code>(partial ...)</code> invocation to continue it further.</p>\n<p>Even if that behaviour is a bit too obscure to justify much design/implementation work, I think the other advantage of a <code>(partial ..)</code> construct is that it would allow more efficient runtime evaluation of an operation with a large number of arguments even if the the interpreter is implemented in an eager rather than lazy fashion.</p>\n<p>(As I understand it, Simplicity slightly extends the approach taken by Liquid, adding 6 jets each for sha256 and sha3)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"compilation-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#compilation-13\"></a>Compilation</h2>\n<p>Anyway, one of the questions above was \u201chow annoying is it to write code\u201d and the answer is, well, \u201cpretty annoying!\u201d</p>\n<p>Having a lazy interpreter so that I can just write <code>(i C nil (x))</code> to check that <code>C</code> is true rather than having to write <code>(a (i C (q q nil) (q x)))</code> makes things a bit easier, but even then managing the environment remains pretty hard, and getting all the quoting right is also pretty hard (Can I just say nil here? Does it need one <code>q</code> or two or\u2026? Do I need to use <code>c</code> to construct a list instead of just quoting it?).</p>\n<p>The good news is that adding a compilation stage that allows you to write named functions with named parameters pretty much fixes that. (And if you\u2019re doing that, you might as well also rewrite <code>if</code> so that you can treat it as lazy, even if the underlying opcode is evaluated by an eager interpreter)</p>\n<p>I hacked something together to make it slightly easier to write some of my examples, but I think mostly what I did there needs to be thrown away and started from scratch, so I\u2019m not really going to describe it. I guess one aspect is probably worth preserving though: it seems much nicer to treat symbols (opcode names, function names, function parameter names) distinct from atoms \u2013 so that <code>(foo)</code> is treated as an error if <code>foo</code> isn\u2019t defined as a symbol somewhere, rather than just being expanded to the three-byte string <code>\"foo\"</code> as occurs with Chia. (One thing that\u2019s probably worth exploring is to write the compiler using a real Lisp, perhaps racket?, treating it as translating from one DSL to another)</p>\n<h2><a name=\"conclusion-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#conclusion-14\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>To go back to my original questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What sort of features are possible if you had Lisp as a transaction language?</li>\n<li>Do the ideas that seem fine in theory turn out to work or fail when you try them in practice?</li>\n<li>How annoying is it to implement/maintain/upgrade a Lisp interpreter?</li>\n<li>How annoying is it to write code in Lisp?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My answers are something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It can be a little expensive on-chain, but it seems like you can do pretty much anything; at least so long as you don\u2019t mind the \u201cscope\u201d constraints that I assumed, like not changing how the UTXO set is stored/queried.</li>\n<li>There were only two things that worried me as far as practice not living up to theory: the first is that some programs seemed slower than I was really comfortable with, but I mostly put that down to them being run under an experimental python evaluation engine; the other just being the conflict between liking Chia\u2019s one-opcode sha256 approach but also liking the flexibility allowed by Liquid\u2019s explicit sha256-midstate handling.</li>\n<li>I don\u2019t think implementing either a Lisp interpreter or the bucket of opcodes that would need to accompany it is too hard.</li>\n<li>It is pretty annoying to write Lisp code without a compiler translating from a higher level representation down to the consensus-level opcodes, but that seems solvable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"future-work-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#future-work-15\"></a>Future work</h2>\n<p>I think there\u2019s a few ways this could be taken further:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>improve the <code>btclisp.py</code> demo code\n<ul>\n<li>fix bugs, implement unimplemented opcodes, clean stuff up</li>\n<li>add a <code>partial</code> opcode (and switch back to eager evaluation?)</li>\n<li>rewrite the \u201ccompiler\u201d to make programming much more accessible</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>work out if there are any interesting contracts that can be built with a more powerful language like this, and how that would look in practice, with <code>btclisp.py</code> based demos</li>\n<li>implementing a language like this and deploying it on signet/inquisition, either:\n<ul>\n<li>with a view to eventually making it available on mainnet or a federated sidechain</li>\n<li>as a way to allow developers to construct and test new smart contracts without writing C++ code or deploying additional consensus upgrades, with a view to designing limited primitives that would support deployment of similar contracts (eg, test vault behaviours implemented in lisp on signet, then take the good ones and design OP_VAULT opcodes that support exactly those behaviours and deploy them on mainnet)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>",

  "raw": "This is a continuation from my post on [Chia Lisp](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/chia-lisp-for-bitcoiners/636). It maintains the bottom-up theme, so again, if this doesn't strike you as innately interesting, maybe just remember that this topic exists so you can refer back to it later as useful background material when we do finally get to something interesting.\n\n<div data-theme-toc=\"true\"> </div>\n\n## Background\n\nSo on and off over the past couple of years I've been poking at what it might look like to have some form of lisp available as an alternative to script, mostly in the form of hackish python code that I call [btclisp.py](https://github.com/ajtowns/lisp-play/blob/916d22c7bc322f66abed361e96e6e991a597173a/btclisp.py). It's mostly designed as a learning tool for me, the idea being to help me figure out answers to questions like:\n\n * What sort of features are possible if you had Lisp as a transaction language?\n * Do the ideas that seem fine in theory turn out to work or fail when you try them in practice?\n * How annoying is it to implement/maintain/upgrade a Lisp interpreter?\n * How annoying is it to write code in Lisp?\n\nIt might be useful context to know that while I'm familiar with functional programming (having dabbled in haskell, hope, coq, lean4), I've never done anything with lisp before (not even emacs lisp). My main sources of inspiration here are Daniel Holden's [Build Your Own Lisp](https://www.buildyourownlisp.com/) and, as mentioned, Chia Lisp.\n\n## Scope\n\nMy idea here is fairly simple: what if we made a Lisp that was a drop-in replacement for [BIP 342 tapscript](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/b3701faef2bdb98a0d7ace4eedbeefa2da4c89ed/bip-0342.mediawiki)? That is, introduce a new tapleaf version, so that when that's used, the taproot script is decoded into a lisp expression, the remaining witness data is stuffed into the environment, and the lisp expression is evaluated, with the result that the transaction is invalid if the evaluation fails, and is valid otherwise.\n\nSome things are out of scope, eg:\n\n * Changing the UTXO database -- Chia's coin set model has different information in its database compared to Bitcoins UTXO set model, which allows for some clever structures. We're not considering that here, since it requires changing the UTXO database, and that is a much more significant change than adding a new tapleaf version.\n * Having scripts interact -- various features of Chia's model allows scripts to interact: conditions allow a script to require that some other script in the same block created or spent a coin; spend bundles allow scripts from different coins to potentially be combined and duplicated; signature aggregation allows signatuers to be, uh, aggregated; and the [`transactions_generator_ref_list`](https://docs.chia.net/block-format/) feature even lets you pull in historical scripts from earlier blocks so you can cheaply reuse code or data from those scripts. All of that is also out of scope.\n * Changing how a tx is treated as a result of the program -- Chia's scripts are often only the first step in validation: eg, in Chia you don't know how much \"space\" a transaction will take up in the block until you evaluate the script, as calculating the cost is a side effect of evaluating the script, and the result of evaluating a script in chia is a set of constraints that also need to be fulfilled by the block. The aim here is not to do that, so that running the script only results in a boolean result, ie \"valid\" or \"invalid\", and any other information (such as weight/cost, timelocks, relationships with other txs) should be available prior to script evaluation.\n\nNone of this is to say that those ideas are necessarily bad, though: just that I'm treating them as out of scope here. That is, this is just about exploring the possibility of using lisp as a tapscript alternative, not more complex changes.\n\n## Summary\n\nAs you might expect, I ended up repeating most of the same design decisions that resulted in Chia lisp, so I'm only going to describe the differences here. Conveniently, there's already another post that discusses [Chia Lisp](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/chia-lisp-for-bitcoiners/636) -- how convenient!\n\n## Opcodes\n\nSo let's start with a run through of the opcodes that I roughly ended up with.\n\n| Opcode | Value | Args | Chia | Description |\n|----|----|----|----|----|\n| `q` (quote) | 0x00 | ... | `q` | special, return arguments unevaluated\n| `a` (apply) | 0x01 | P ENV... | `a` | build ENV... args into an environment, run P in that environment\n| `x` (exception) | 0x02 | ... | `x` | fail the program (provides args as error message when debugging)\n| `i` (if) | 0x03 | C T E | `i` | if C is not nil, return T, otherwise E\n| `sf` (softfork) | 0x04 | M P ENV... | `softfork` | similar to `a`, but with new evaluation rules defined b y M, always evaluates to nil\n| `c` (cons) | 0x05 | H T | `c` | build a cons element with H and T\n| `h` (head) | 0x06 | L | `f` | return the head element of L, fail if L is not a cons\n| `t` (tail) | 0x07 | L | `r` | return the tail element of L, fail if L is not a cons \n| `l` (list?) | 0x08 | X | `l` | return 1 if X is a cons, or nil if X is an atom\n| `b` (bintree) | 0x20 | ENV... | | construct a balanced, left-biased binary tree consisting of each of the arguments\n| `not` (nand) | 0x09 | A B ... | `not` | if all of A, B.. are nil return 1, else return nil\n| `all` | 0x0a | A B ... | `all` | if any of A, B... are nil return nil, else return 1\n| `any` | 0x0b | A B ... | `any` | if all of A, B... are nil return nil, else return 1\n| `=` (eq) | 0x0c | A B C ... | `=` | if all of B, C... equal A return 1, else nil\n| `<s` (lt_str) | 0x0d | *A *B *C ... | `>s` | if A is less than B (lexicographically), C is less than B, etc return 1, else nil\n| `strlen` | 0x0e | *A *B ... | `strlen` | return the sum of the lengths of A, B, etc\n| `substr` | 0x0f | *A *B *E | `substr` | return the substring of A, starting at position B, ending at position E; if B is missing return A, if E is missing, treat it as `(strlen A)`\n| `cat` | 0x10 | *A *B ... | `concat` | return a new atom with A, B, etc concatenated together` |\n| `~` (nand_u64) | 0x11 | *A *B ... | `lognot` | treat the values as u64, and nand them together\n| `&` (and_u64) | 0x12 | *A *B ... | `logand` | treat the values as u64, and and them together\n| `\\|` (or_u64) | 0x13 | *A *B ... | `logior` | treat the values as u64, and or them together\n| `^` (xor_u64) | 0x14 | *A *B ... | `logxor` | treat the values as u64, and xor them together\n| `+` (add) | 0x17 | *A *B ... | `+` | add A, B, etc together\n| `-` (sub) | 0x18 | *A *B ... | `-` | subtract B, ... from A\n| `*` (mul) | 0x19 | *A *B ... | `*` | multiply A, B, ... together\n| `%` (mod) | 0x1a | *A *B | `%` | return remainder of A after division by B\n| `/%` (divmod) | 0x1b | *A *B | `divmod` | return a pair, ((/ A B) . (% A B))\n| `<<` (lshift) | 0x1c | *A *B | `lsh` | shift A left by B\n| `>>` (rshift) | 0x1d | *A *B | `lsh` | shift A right by B (two opcodes needed since B is treated as unsigned)\n| `**%` (modexp) | | *N *E *M | `modpow` | return N raised to the power E modulo M\n| `<` (lt_le) | 0x1e | *A *B *C ... | | if A is less than B (treated as unsigned little endian), B is less than C, etc return 1, else nil\n| `log2b42` | 0x1f | *A | | calculates $\\log_2(A) * 2^{42}$\n| `rd` (read) | 0x22 | *A | | deserializes byte string A into a lisp expression\n| `wr` (write) | 0x23 | A | | serializes lisp expression A into a byte string\n| `sha256` | 0x24 | *A *B ... | `sha256` | produces the sha256 hash of the concatenation of A, B, etc\n| `ripemd160` | 0x25 | *A *B ... | | produces the ripemd160 hash of the concatenation of A, B, etc\n| `hash160` | 0x26 | *A *B ... | | produces the ripemd160 hash of the sha256 of the concatenation of A, B, etc\n| `hash256` | 0x27 | *A *B ... | | produces the double sha256 hash of the concatenation of A, B, etc\n| `bip340_verify` | 0x28 | *K *M *S | | performs the BIP 340 verification function on key K, message M, signature S, returns 0 if S is nil, fails the script if the verification fails, otherwise returns 1\n| `ecdsa_verify` | 0x29 | *K *M *S | `secp256k1_verify` | performs ECDSA verification of key K, message M, signature S\n| `secp256k1_muladd` | 0x2a | A B ... | | check that A+B+... sum to the point at infinity. fail the program if not, return 1 otherwise. (see below for details)\n| `tx` | 0x2b | A B ... | | return information about the tx (see below for details)\n| `bip342_txmsg` | 0x2c | *SIGHASH | | calculate the signature message for the tx per BIP 342, given an optional SIGHASH byte\n\nAsterisks mark arguments that must be atoms. This gives about 45 opcodes total, though not all of them are implemented in btclisp.py at all, and some that are are implemented incorrectly -- it's a learning tool after all: the reader needs some exercises!\n\nSome details on some of the above:\n\n### Quoting\n\nActually, one thing I'll note first: my expression parser allows abbreviating `(q . x)` as `'x`. No big deal, but it makes things easier to write, so I'll make use of that abbreviation below.\n\n### Environment trees\n\n[Chia-style environment structuring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbZ8zDpX2Mg) is pretty neat, but it's more optimal if your environment is structured as a binary tree, rather than a list -- with a list, each element is put in position 2, 5, 11, 23, 47, 95, etc, with each subsequent position being $p_{n+1} = 2p_n+1$, effectively doubling the value each time. But if done with a small binary tree instead, you only need values up to $2n$ (well, $2^{\\lceil \\log_2(2n) \\rceil}$), so 6 elements could be instead encoded as 8, 12, 10, 14, 5, 7. Whether that really matters is debatable, however at some point serializing a reference to a larger number becomes less efficient that a smaller number would be, so optimisation here has some potential to be useful.\n\nIn any event, I implemented this behaviour for the ENV... parameters in the `a` opcode, and via the `b` opcode: in both cases, if you provide those operators 4 arguments, they'll convert that list into a balanced tree of conses, going from `(a b c d)` to `((a . b) . (c . d))`. If the `sf` opcode were implemented, the same behaviour would apply there too.\n\n### ECC calculations\n\nThe `secp256k1_muladd` opcode allows doing ECC operations by hand to some degree, in particular it allows making assertions along the lines of `a*P + b*Q = c*R` where `a`, `b`, `c` are scalars, and `P`, `Q`, `R` are points on the secp256k1 curve. There are a few tricks to the encoding for this operation:\n\n * if an argument is an atom, it's treated as expressing a scalar multiple of the generator, ie `a*G`\n * if the argument is a cons, the head part is treated as the scalar, and the tail part as the point, ie `h*T`; the point can either be a normal 33-byte point, or a 32-byte x-only point\n * if the head part of the cons is nil, the scalar is treated as -1\n * if the tail part of the cons is nil, the point is treated as `-G`\n * rather than treat one of the arguments as being alone on its side of the equal signs, we actually evaluate `a*P + b*Q + c*R = 0` (where 0 is the point at infinity)\n * scalars are treated as big-endian numbers (matching the treatment in BIP 340), which diverges from the little-endian approach elsewhere here\n\nThe BIP 340 verification equation (`s*G = R + h*P`) can thus be expressed as `(secp256k1_muladd (s . nil) (1 . R) (h . P))`. This allows writing `bip340_verify` directly, something like:\n\n```lisp\n(a '(secp256k1_muladd \n       (c '1 4) \n       (c (sha256 5 4 7 (bip342_txmsg)) 7)\n       (c 6 nil)\n     )\n    (substr 3 0 '32)\n    (substr 3 '32 '64)\n    (a '(cat 1 1) (sha256 '\"BIP0340/challenge\"))\n    2\n)`\n```\n\nassuming the initial environment is `(key . sig)`.\n\nI think that serves as an example of how you could use the building blocks provided by a reasonably powerful language with reasonably generic opcodes in order to experiment with new functionality, in this case getting the functionality of BIP 340, without having to first get the logic implemented in C++ and merged into bitcoin core, eg.\n\n(For example, being able to implement BIP 340 Schnorr signature verification by hand, means you have the option of tweaking the construction to make different design choices than BIP 340 did, eg to allow signatures to not commit to their own signing key.)\n\n### Transaction Introspection\n\nAlmost any interesting new functionality is going to require some logic based on the transaction -- so if we want to make experimenting with ideas like `SIGHASH_ANYPREVOUT` or `OP_CSV` possible without having to implement them in C++ first, then you need something that pulls out information about the transaction being validated. This is what the `tx` op is all about. It's very straightforward: you give it a list of arguments that tell it what bits of information about the tx you want, and it gives you all that information back. (Except, if you only want one piece of information, it won't wrap that in a list, to save you a call to `h`)\n\nThe bits of information currently supported are:\n\n| number | level | description\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 0 | tx | nVersion\n| 1 | tx | nLockTime\n| 2 | tx | number of inputs\n| 3 | tx | number of outputs\n| 4 | tx | index of input for this script\n| 5 | tx | full tx without witness\n| 6 | tx | tapleaf hash for the current script\n| 7 | tx | taproot internal public key for this input\n| 8 | tx | taproot merkle path to this script for this input\n| - | tx | (missing) taproot parity bit, leaf version, script for this input\n| |\n| 10 | input | nSequence\n| 11 | input | prevout hash\n| 12 | input | prevout index\n| 13 | input | scriptSig\n| 14 | input | annex (nil if not present, annex including 0x50 prefix if present)\n| 15 | input | coin being spent's nValue\n| 16 | input | coin being spent's scriptPubKey\n|| \n| 20 | output | nValue\n| 21 | output | scriptPubKey\n\nThe idea here is that if you just specify the number, eg `(tx 5 13 20)` you'll get the corresponding data for the current input, or the output with the same index as the current input, and if you want to investigate a different input/output, you use a cons pair to specify the number and the input/output that you're interested in, eg: `(tx (10 . 0) (20 . 0))`.\n\nNote that for other inputs, only the scriptSig and annex are made available, not the entire witness stack; the idea being twofold: first, that the witness stack for other inputs may depend on future soft forks, and not be something you can analyse meaningfully, and second, that we could reasonably aim to keep the annex small, so that analysing other inputs' annexes is a quick and cheap operation, while their witness data may be large, causing analysis of it to be slow and expensive.\n\nThis does not currently define a format for putting data in the annex, and hence does not provide functionality for pulling snippets of data out of the annex. Probably that would be best done via an `annex` opcode.\n\nThe `bip342_txmsg` opcode gives you a way of grabbing the specific tx information needed for signing per BIP 342. You can implement `txmsg` directly, but it gets complicated:\n\n```lisp\n(a '(a '(sha256 4 4 '0x00 6 3) \n       (sha256 '\\\"TapSighash\\\") \n       (cat '0x00 (tx '0) (tx '1)\n            (sha256 (a 1 1 '(cat (tx (c '11 1)) (tx (c '12 1))) '0 (tx '2) 'nil))\n            (sha256 (a 1 1 '(tx (c '15 1)) '0 (tx '2) 'nil))\n            (sha256 (a 1 1 '(a '(cat (strlen 1) 1) (tx '(16 . 0))) '0 (tx '2) 'nil))\n            (sha256 (a 1 1 '(tx (c '10 1)) '0 (tx '2) 'nil))\n            (sha256 (a 1 1 '(cat (tx (c '20 1)) (a '(cat (strlen 1) 1) (tx (c '21 1)))) '0 (tx '3) 'nil))\n            (i (tx '14) '0x03 '0x01)\n            (substr (cat (tx '4) '0x00000000) 'nil '4)\n            (i (tx '14) (sha256 (a '(cat (strlen 1) 1) (tx '14))) 'nil)\n       )\n       (cat (tx '6) '0x00 '0xffffffff)\n    ) \n   '(a (i 14 '(a 8 8 12 (+ 10 '1) (- 14 '1) (cat 3 (a 12 10))) '3))\n)\n```\n\nThe above assumes that SIGHASH_DEFAULT is all that's desired, that `OP_CODESEPERATOR` has not been used and that the `scriptPubKey` length is under 253 (to avoid doing proper `CompactSize` encoding).\n\n## Numbers\n\nThere's already a topic up about [64 bit arithmetic in script](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/64-bit-arithmetic-soft-fork/397) and many of the same considerations from there apply here: if we want to be able to deal with sat values of  we need more than script's current 32-bit CScriptNum's. I went with the easy approach and just said \"math operators treat their inputs as 64-bit unsigned little-endian numbers, truncating if necessary\". My guess is that having arbitrary size little-endian numbers with the highest bit acting as a sign bit (matching CScriptNum behaviour) is probably more sensible though.\n\nAdding a `strrev` function would allow easily swapping a positive number to it's big-endian representation, which would then make it possible to calculate scalars for use with `secp256k1_muladd`, which may be useful.\n\n## Serialization\n\nWhile Chia's serialization format is admirably simple, I thought it would make sense to have one that was more optimised for the use case. In that vein, I figured the following things were likely to be frequent and that it might be worth minimising the overhead for them:\n\n * nil\n * small numbers (for opcodes and environment references, eg 0x01 to 0x2f)\n * small atoms (strings of up to 64 bytes so that we can include bip340 signatures, eg)\n * small lists (eg, lists with one through five elements plus the terminator)\n * nil-terminated lists (ie, mark lists as proper or improper, so that a nil terminator is implied)\n * quoted elements\n\nSo I picked the following encoding:\n\n| byte value | meaning |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0x00 | nil | \n| 0x01 - 0x33 | one byte atom with value 0x01 to 0x33\n| 0x34 | leftover atoms: if the next byte is 0x00 or 0x34 to 0xFF, then it is that single byte atom, if the next byte is 0x01 to 0x33 (s), then a multibyte atom of length 64+1 to 64+33 bytes follows\n| 0x35 - 0x73 | multibyte atom of length 2 to 64 bytes follows\n| 0x74 | read a length value (0-inf), a multibyte atom of length 64+33+1+(0 to inf) bytes follows\n| 0x75 - 0x79 | a nil-terminated list of 1 to 5 entries, those entries follow immediately\n| 0x7a - 0x7e | an improper list of 2 to 6 entries, those entries follow immediately (the last one being the terminator)\n| 0x7f | a list of more than five entries; first read the size and whether the list is nil-terinated, then the entries in the list follow\n| 0x80 - 0xff | the same as 0x00 to 0x7f, except quoted\n\nWith this encoding, the programs above to verify a schnorr signature and to calculate the BIP 342 sighash serialise to:\n\n> ```7f0001f82a7705810477057924050407752c0777050600780f0300a0780f03a0b4407701f71001017624c4424950303334302f6368616c6c656e676502``` (61 bytes)\n\nand\n\n> ```7701f901ff00240404b40006037624bd546170536967686173687f0610b400762b80762b8176247f01010101f710762b77058b01762b77058c0180762b828076247f01010101f62b77058f0180762b828076247f01010101f701f710760e0101762bf51080762b828076247f01010101f62b77058a0180762b828076247f01010101f710762b770594017701f710760e0101762b7705950180762b83807803762b8e8381780f7710762b84b70000000080847803762b8e76247701f710760e0101762b8e807810762b86b400b7fffffffff60178030eff010108080c77170a8177180e8177100377010c0a83``` (236 bytes)\n\nCertainly preferable to use a built-in one byte opcode when it's available, but if there isn't an opcode that does exactly what you want and the only alternative is waiting for a consensus change to be developed, supported, merged, deployed and activated, then costing about the same as a 2-of-3 multisig seems pretty good. If you're not trying to match an existing spec, then some more bytes can be shaved off by designing your hash to match what's easily expressible with the provided opcodes, too -- eg, just grab the data you want via `(tx ...)`, then serialize it with `(wr (tx ...))` then take the hash of that `(sha256 (wr (tx ..)))`, and things should be both easier and cheaper, without losing any expressivity or security.\n\n## Costing\n\nThe above assumes that the witness size in bytes is the important thing to worry about when working out the cost of a script. That's true today, but it isn't true with any language that allows looping: with the ability to do iteration or recursion, a program that takes only a few bytes to write down, can take a large amount of time or memory to actually conclude.\n\nI think there's three fundamental things to worry about:\n\n * the size of the program -- this has to be revealed on the blockchain, so takes up bandwidth and space accordingly\n * the amount of time/compute needed to run the program -- all the programs in a block should complete within a few seconds; so any individual program should take up time proportional to how much of the block weight limit it uses up\n * the amount of memory needed to run the program -- currently, script programs are limited to operating on about 500kB of data on the stack (including the altstack), while that could be expanded, maintaining a small fixed limit is probably wise\n\nI included a rough sketch of how those limits might be monitored (`ALLOCATOR.limit` sets a global allocation limit to track the memory usage being used, and `ALLOCATOR.effort_limit` nominally tracks the total computation resources, assuming calls to `ALLOCATOR.record_work(x)` are made when computation is done), but haven't actually set the costs of various functionality in any meaningful way. Really, I figure that we'd need to do a realistic implementation of all the opcodes in C++, then benchmark them to produce realistic costs, then work backwards from that to set the overall computation limit per block.\n\nNote that costing current memory usage implies defining a \"consensus-preferred\" way of evaluating the program: eager vs lazy evaluation, tail call elimination, and order of evaluation can all require different amounts of memory to each other for different programs, and because exceeding the memory usage limit would render a transaction invalid, consistently and accurately accounting for that limit is consensus critical in this model. That doesn't mean optimisation can't be done, though, it just means that the costing/limit checking is an additional result of evaluation, and it must not be changed as a result of any optimisations.\n\n## Midstates\n\nOne of the interesting things Liquid/Elements did [a little while ago now](https://blog.blockstream.com/tapscript-new-opcodes-reduced-limits-and-covenants/) was to add \"streaming hash opcodes\":\n\n> We added \u201cstreaming hash\u201d opcodes to allow feeding data into a hash engine without needing to put it all into a single stack element. This cleanly avoids the 520-byte stack element limit without requiring any more resource usage from the script interpreter.\n\nThese took the form of `OP_SHA256INITIALIZE` (takes a string, generates a midstate), `OP_SHA256UPDATE` (takes a midstate and string, generates a midstate), `OP_SHA256FINALIZE` (takes a midstate and string, generates the final hash). So instead of `A B C CAT CAT SHA256` you might have `A SHA256INIT B SHA256UPDATE C SHA256FINALIZE`.\n\nThe direct consequence of this, that you can generate a hash from a sequence of small pieces of data without having to combine them first, isn't interesting here, as we can simply provide the same sequence of small pieces of data as arguments to the `(sha256 ...)` opcode, and achieve the same result.\n\nThat's fine as far as it goes, but when you consider making the underlying scripting language more powerful, it's worth considering how that changes things. So there are effectively two important differences:\n\n * Interleaving calculation of the input values to the hash function and calls to update\n * Reusing inputs across different hash functions\n\nFor an example of the first issue, suppose (as a programming exercise) you wanted to calculate the sha256 of the concatenation of the first 2000 fibonacci numbers. With Chia's model, namely having a multi-argument sha256 opcode and eager evaluation, this would require first calculating the 2000 fibonacci numbers, then running sha256 over them, requiring about 174kB of memory to store binary representations for all those numbers, rather than calculating them, feeding them to the hash function, then discarding them as the next number is calculated.\n\nAn approach that solves that problem is lazy evaluation: you construct a program that generates the list of `(sha256 1 1 2 3 5 ...)` for your 2000 fibonacci numbers, then you call `a` on it. Because the evaluation happens lazily, nothing is calculated until the sha256 opcode actually needs its next argument, and the simplest way of writing the program automatically becomes relatively efficient.\n\nHowever the second challenge can't be resolved by leaving it up to the interpreter -- working out when to interleave calculations might be possible to automate, but certainly seems to complex to add as a consensus feature.\n\nA possible generic approach to making that feature available might be adding a \"partial application\" opcode, so that writing `(partial sha256 a b c)` returns a special \"function\" object that encapsulates the midstate of having hashed `a b c` without any finalisation. That object could then be passed to `a` to finish the operation, or could be passed to another `(partial ...)` invocation to continue it further.\n\nEven if that behaviour is a bit too obscure to justify much design/implementation work, I think the other advantage of a `(partial ..)` construct is that it would allow more efficient runtime evaluation of an operation with a large number of arguments even if the the interpreter is implemented in an eager rather than lazy fashion.\n\n(As I understand it, Simplicity slightly extends the approach taken by Liquid, adding 6 jets each for sha256 and sha3)\n\n## Compilation\n\nAnyway, one of the questions above was \"how annoying is it to write code\" and the answer is, well, \"pretty annoying!\"\n\nHaving a lazy interpreter so that I can just write `(i C nil (x))` to check that `C` is true rather than having to write `(a (i C (q q nil) (q x)))` makes things a bit easier, but even then managing the environment remains pretty hard, and getting all the quoting right is also pretty hard (Can I just say nil here? Does it need one `q` or two or...? Do I need to use `c` to construct a list instead of just quoting it?).\n\nThe good news is that adding a compilation stage that allows you to write named functions with named parameters pretty much fixes that. (And if you're doing that, you might as well also rewrite `if` so that you can treat it as lazy, even if the underlying opcode is evaluated by an eager interpreter)\n\nI hacked something together to make it slightly easier to write some of my examples, but I think mostly what I did there needs to be thrown away and started from scratch, so I'm not really going to describe it. I guess one aspect is probably worth preserving though: it seems much nicer to treat symbols (opcode names, function names, function parameter names) distinct from atoms -- so that `(foo)` is treated as an error if `foo` isn't defined as a symbol somewhere, rather than just being expanded to the three-byte string `\"foo\"` as occurs with Chia. (One thing that's probably worth exploring is to write the compiler using a real Lisp, perhaps racket?, treating it as translating from one DSL to another)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo go back to my original questions:\n\n * What sort of features are possible if you had Lisp as a transaction language?\n * Do the ideas that seem fine in theory turn out to work or fail when you try them in practice?\n * How annoying is it to implement/maintain/upgrade a Lisp interpreter?\n * How annoying is it to write code in Lisp?\n\nMy answers are something like:\n\n * It can be a little expensive on-chain, but it seems like you can do pretty much anything; at least so long as you don't mind the \"scope\" constraints that I assumed, like not changing how the UTXO set is stored/queried.\n * There were only two things that worried me as far as practice not living up to theory: the first is that some programs seemed slower than I was really comfortable with, but I mostly put that down to them being run under an experimental python evaluation engine; the other just being the conflict between liking Chia's one-opcode sha256 approach but also liking the flexibility allowed by Liquid's explicit sha256-midstate handling.\n * I don't think implementing either a Lisp interpreter or the bucket of opcodes that would need to accompany it is too hard.\n * It is pretty annoying to write Lisp code without a compiler translating from a higher level representation down to the consensus-level opcodes, but that seems solvable.\n\n## Future work\n\nI think there's a few ways this could be taken further:\n\n 1. improve the `btclisp.py` demo code\n    * fix bugs, implement unimplemented opcodes, clean stuff up\n    * add a `partial` opcode (and switch back to eager evaluation?)\n    * rewrite the \"compiler\" to make programming much more accessible\n 2. work out if there are any interesting contracts that can be built with a more powerful language like this, and how that would look in practice, with `btclisp.py` based demos\n 3. implementing a language like this and deploying it on signet/inquisition, either:\n    * with a view to eventually making it available on mainnet or a federated sidechain\n    * as a way to allow developers to construct and test new smart contracts without writing C++ code or deploying additional consensus upgrades, with a view to designing limited primitives that would support deployment of similar contracts (eg, test vault behaviours implemented in lisp on signet, then take the good ones and design OP_VAULT opcodes that support exactly those behaviours and deploy them on mainnet)",
