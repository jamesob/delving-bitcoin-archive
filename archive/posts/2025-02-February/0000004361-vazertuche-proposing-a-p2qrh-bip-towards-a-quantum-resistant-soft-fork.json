They would simply make it standard practice to always include at least one Quantum Lamport signature path within the script tree of every taproot address generated. In the event of a sudden quantum attack, we could immediately roll out the soft fork adding a segwit v2 quantum address type and also enables taproot spending of the hidden Lamport script path.

Personally, I don\u2019t believe there is any evidence of a quantum computer being able to break our encryption for at least 15 to 20 years. But that\u2019s besides the point.  Using this approach allows us to leverage the time needed to work out the robust math that Bitcoin requires and also allows us to be proactive about doing something in the meantime. In 20 years, we could have easily already moved consensus to a proven lattice based crypto that is more compact and then after that, hopefully to a proven supersingular EC Isogeny crypto also that is compact enough to be acceptable to Bitcoins size constraints AND we can do all this without ever actually implementing any type of fork.</p>\n<p>In this hypothetical scenario, when the quantum attack happens in 20 years then 90% of people will be able to move their taproot addresses via the newest quantum algo, 8% on the older lattice algo and 1% using the oldest Lamport algo. The remaining 1% will either be lost or we can allow ECDSA and Schnorr script path spends ONLY. These people would be able to connect directly with a mining pool via a quantum secure connection and spend that way.</p>\n<p>Yes, trust will be assumed on the miner but it is better than just having those people get burned. In addition, this whole plan requires trust that any of these offline algo\u2019s will ever get implemented via a soft-fork. In addition, what about all the people not using taproot addresses? All things being equal, while it would seem that taproot addresses are the worst option to use in this new quantum world they might actually be our salvation.</p>\n<p>Given the quirky nature taptweak and the two different spending paths, we can use that to our advantage. It can\u2019t be overstated how powerful a taproot address in which the primary path is un-spendable via a NUMS point is.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s powerful since it acts as a honeytrap for a quantum computer. If it was my address and a quantum computer stole the funds, I would be able to raise the alarm to everyone that it WAS in fact a quantum computer that stole the funds. I would be able to prove this by revealing the necessary info to show that the primary path was in fact an un-spendable NUMS point and that I had true ownership over a pubkey in the script path. (In fact, you wouldn\u2019t even need to do the last part.

If a majority of UTXO\u2019s actually move to taproot and if wallets begin to make it common practice to make the primary path un-spendable if necessary and even if not necessary (example: to create deliberate honey pot addresses) then we\u2019ve effectively laid out land mines for a quantum computer. Any adversary who gains the first quantum mover advantage will want to retain that advantage as long as possible without alerting the world at large. The fact that any attack on a Bitcoin address \u201ccould\u201d fully reveal their advantage would be incentive enough to not even try to attack Bitcoin.
