It's highly dependent on a node's traffic, which is likely quite variable during the day, and will change as channels open and close. Interested to hear whether anyone's aware of research that we could look at to inform picking such a value?\n\nIt seems to me that message padding and some degree of cover traffic (dandelion for LN?) offer better privacy protections than forwarding delays because:\n1. They'd offer protection to nodes on the edges of the graph that have less traffic (unlikely to be able to batch otherwise).\n2. A bandwidth/privacy tradeoff is probably more palatable to forwarding nodes than a latency/privacy one (adding 30 GB egress to AWS is like $3), so they're more likely to adhere to this measure.\n3. An attacker can probe latency without attributable failures (albeit at a cost, in an unconditional fee world)\n\nAll that to say, it's not obvious to me that we're closing ourselves off to future privacy improvements because (IMO) forwarding delays seem to be the least promising of the mitigations available to us.\n\nWould folks consider leaving ms encoding and adding a sender-side advisory in the specification not to penalize hops under some threshold (300ms)?
