This serves to reduce the minimum on-chain payout threshold of non-custodial pools down to the dust limit.[^1] It is currently very much higher than the dust limit at Ocean.\n3. Remove the disincentive for non-custodial pools to limit the number of payouts in order to increase transaction fee profits.\n\n\n\n[^1]: For those who don't read carefully (you really should): \"down to the dust limit\" does not imply a preference for the size of these outputs.
