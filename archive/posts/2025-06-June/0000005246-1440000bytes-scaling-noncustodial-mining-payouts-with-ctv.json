I have added Coinbase Playground in https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Covenants_Uses\n\nIIUC this solves 2 problems without involving ASP:\n\n1. Antminer [coinbase size limit](https://x.com/GrassFedBitcoin/status/1832473863537717308)\n2. Leaves room to add more transactions in block (i.e. more fees)\n\nNote: Miners can use [ark on-chain](https://docs.second.tech/getting-started/barking-on-signet/advanced/) addresses as payout addresses.",
