Thank you for reading and commenting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do not see how what you describe scales non-custodial mining payouts (the title of this post), or maximizes fee revenues</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can define non-custodial mining payouts as such: newly created UTXOs in the coinbase of a bitcoin block that are unable to be spent by any party other than the intended recipient of that payout. Every large pool today, with the exception of Ocean, sends the coinbase outputs to a custodial wallet and renders payouts from that wallet. This means the pool operator could rug their miners by simply not transferring the bitcoin from their wallet to the miner\u2019s wallet. In this sense, Ocean is a non-custodial pool for all miners who receive a coinbase output in a given Ocean block.</p>\n<p>Ocean is limited in the number of these outputs they can produce each block by two factors. The first is a hard limit: Some ASIC appliance firmware places a limit on the size of the coinbase. The second is a soft limit: since the coinbase counts against the maximum block size limit, pools are incentivized to use the smallest possible coinbase in order to maximize fee revenue in each block.</p>\n<p>CTV sidesteps both limitations. It enables an effectively unlimited number of non-custodial payouts in each block mined while improving pool profitability compared to the status quo. In other words, CTV scales non-custodial mining payouts.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At best this is a congestion control claim</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not a congestion control claim. The heart of my argument is that CTV unfetters trustless mining payouts. Trusted systems are a security vulnerability, as asserted by Satoshi in the first two sentences of the white paper. CTV can fundamentally improve the trust model of bitcoin mining. Proof of work mining is the foundation of bitcoin\u2019s trust model. Therefore, CTV can be used to fundamentally improve the trust model of bitcoin.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>increasing your block space usage would work against maximizing your fee revenues</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m not sure how you reach this conclusion. You appear to be considering total block space usage for the bitcoin network in the context of a single mining pool. This doesn\u2019t translate. CTV can very slightly increase total blockspace usage but this is not a concern for a mining pool operator unless they are producing all of the blocks on the network. In practice, every custodial pool externalizes their payout costs to future blocks using fanout transactions. My design is only different in the trust model used.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Using Ark for payouts instead introduces some additional assumptions but at least does make sense from a scalability perspective</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am very bullish on Ark for payments. I\u2019m also very excited about how it can be used to improve mining operations and scalability. Again, you are talking about scalability of the entire bitcoin system. In this post I am focused on scaling trustless mining payouts beyond the limitations it faces under current consensus rules.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the intention of this post was to motivate a CTV soft fork</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My intention is to improve bitcoin\u2019s chance of long-term success as a self-sovereign monetary commodity by improving the mining stack. I believe that mining pool centralization is currently the biggest threat to bitcoin and therefore this is the highest impact work I can do. I did not wade into the CTV debate earlier because I didn\u2019t have a concrete proposal in an area of domain expertise. (This was the case the last time we talked.)</p>\n<p>I have chosen a domain. I am working hard to gain practical expertise. And I have found (I believe) a very compelling use for CTV within my domain. I plan to continue building use cases for CTV+CSFS, as indicated at the end of the github readme. If you still question my motives you can also reach out to me personally.
