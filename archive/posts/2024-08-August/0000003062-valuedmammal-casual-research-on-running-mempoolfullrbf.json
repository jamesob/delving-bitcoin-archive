The fullrbf node is an always-on server while the bip125 node is a pruned node on an old laptop that is off most of the time. I attempted to smooth out that variation by making sure the nodes were peered with one another giving them the opportunity to share their own mempool contents.\n\nOne of the reasons I took on this exploration was to engage in a larger discussion about the health of the p2p network. It's important that node operators have a habit of monitoring statistics to track changes in usage by network participants.\n\nThe score is intentionally \"dumb\". We would like it to have a value close to 1, but deviations from perfect aren't necessarily a cause for concern. Indeed we expect to see variation by virtue of the distributed network - some nodes see some transactions and other nodes see others. It would be unrealistic to expect perfection from every block - certainly that would make it less useful as a metric. Thankfully I was surprised to observe such high p2p scores on a regular basis. In contrast, witnessing large or prolonged deviations could be a sign that either **1)** local policy has fallen adrift of the wider network or **2)** significant volumes of transactions are confirming having never entered the mempool to begin with.\n\nIn terms of policy I don't take a stance on whether nodes should conform to miner practices or vice versa.
