Core PQC algorithms (Kyber, FrodoKEM, NTRU) integrated.\n2. Hybrid key management system in place.\n3. PQC transaction signing enabled.\n4. Flexible configuration options.\n\nGitHub Repository:\nhttps://github.com/QBlockQ/pqc-bitcoin\n\nIt is worth highlighting that progression of quantum computers is a problem and the latest one was yesterday when the Williow chip has been announced, which has the largest semiprime can factored!.
