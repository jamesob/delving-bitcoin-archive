Thus, it must use a mechanism that allows the client to hide its identity, but this also lets potential DoS attackers to hide their identity.\nAgain: lookup must not be free.</p>\n<p>However, again, remember that the goal is for the client to be able to recover all data it has.\nIf it needs tokens in order to read from the store, but the client has lost its cache of tokens because it lost ALL of its data except its root private key (represented by 12/24 words), how can the client recover anything?</p>\n<p>The answer is to provide a second, \u201cbreak glass\u201d storage.\nThis is a much smaller key-value store, where keys are again SECP256K1 points (public keys), but values are tiny blobs, just enough to fit the encrypted form of a WabiSabi credential.</p>\n<p>The breakglass storage has this interface:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>insert-or-replace - costs tokens, inserts a public key and inserts or replaces the value.\n<ul>\n<li>Requires a signature from the public key.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>lookup-and-deferred-delete - give a public key, get value.\n<ul>\n<li>Requires a signature from the public key, but does NOT cost tokens (this is breakglass).</li>\n<li>On success, a timer starts ticking and the entry is deleted after the timer runs out.</li>\n<li>The lookup operation can be repeated until the timer runs out.</li>\n<li>The timer should be relatively long, unit of hours or days.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The tokens spent to insert into the breakglass storage effectively pays for both the insertion and long-term storage of the small amount of data, and the subsequent lookup.\nLooking up deletes the data, as the tokens used to insert to the breakglass limit the number of bytes that can be retrieved later, and prevents this mechanism from being abused to store the data instead of the primary store.\nDeletion is timered instead of immediate, as network is unreliable \u2014 the server might receive the request, but the network (or the client) may fail before the client can receive the request and re-seed its token cache with the breakglass.\nDuring the timeout, the client may recover or re-attempt the read, to still recover the data, but the data is \u201cdoomed\u201d and WILL be deleted to prevent abuse of the breakglass store.</p>\n<p>Further, storage, on a per-byte basis, must be more expensive for the breakglass compared to the primary storage, thus encouraging users to use the primary storage for actual mass data.</p>\n<p>The breakglass store is effectively a persistent \u201cidentity\u201d for a client.\nHowever, the only activity on the breakglass is to initially put some tokens into it for emergency recovery purposes.\nAny token system like this would have \u201cepochs\u201d where old tokens are made invalid and need to be \u201creissued\u201d to the latest epoch, so the breakglass has to update that, but importantly this is NOT correlated to the client write or read activity in the primary store, only to epochs, thus is not a major privacy leak; it only leaks that \u201cthe client is still willing to pay for continued recoverable storage for the current epoch\u201d.</p>\n<p>The client may use any fixed derivation from their root private key.\nIf used for LN state storage, the key used in the breakglass MUST NOT be the same as used as any node ID of the client.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"client-operation-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#client-operation-4\"></a>Client Operation</h3>\n<p>An important power of the client is that a client can get any number of public keys.\nThe space of keys is so vast that we expect that the server will run out of space faster than the number of possible public keys.</p>\n<p>Let us focus on CLN.  In CLN, the <code>db_write</code> hook provides a counter.  A client using CLN that wants to save <code>db_write</code> querysets can simply HMAC the counter with the node private key and then use that to create the keypair used to insert data into the primary store.\nThe <code>db_write</code> queries can be divided into batches that fit into the blob size, and if it requires more than one blob, it can get some entropy, store that in the blob, and then get the node private key plus the entropy to generate a new keypair for the continuation of the data, creating a singly-linked list of blobs. (Implementation-wise, it really ought to insert the continuation blobs and ensure they are inserted before inserting the head blob for that version).</p>\n<p>On recovery, the recovery process can simply iterate over versions (again, by just HMACing the counter value with the node private key) and look them up on the server, acquiring blobs of <code>db_write</code> querysets that can be applied to a starting database.  When the last version is found, the recovery process has completed.</p>\n<p>For LDK, each channel has its own monotonic counter.  In such a case, the \u201cmain\u201d sequence would contain openings and closings of channels.  This would require a separate counter for the sequence of channel opens and closes, which can be implemented outside of LDK.  A channel closing can allow deletion of data as well, to refund some amount of tokens.</p>\n<p>On recovery on LDK, we go through the \u201cmain\u201d sequence, looking at channel openings and closings, until we reach the final version and get a canonical list of currently-open channels.  Then the recovery process can start downloading individual updates of the currently-open channels \u2014 for instance, they could HMAC the channel ID and the counter, with the node private key, to get the key to the blobs containing each <code>ChannelMonitorUpdate</code>.</p>\n<p>Note that this use of counters can be used for any other store.  For example, it would be possible to write an immutable b-tree implementation that can be used to back a database or fileystem on such a service.  The client is free to implement any number of data storage schemes with any index, with the superpower of getting any number of public keys derived from its root private key, as we expect that the amount of data that any client can feasibly generate and store will be much smaller than the space of valid SECP256K1 keys.</p>\n<p>Any equality index can be converted to a public key by just HMACing a canonical serialization of the index key with the client root private key.  Thus, any kind of key-value store can be built on top of this mechanism.</p>\n<p>Actual datastores might want to \u201croll up\u201d some of the old data, so that a sequence of updates is replaced with some \u201clatest\u201d version.  This is left as an exercise to the reader.  For instance, the \u201cmain sequence\u201d might just contain a reference to the root of an immutable Merklized data structure (such as an immutable b-tree).  As data gets updated, older versions may be deleted over time once new latest anchors have been written to the store.  On recovery, the main sequence is traversed and the latest anchor can be recovered.  This lets clients delete some blobs and recover tokens for those, which also reduces the amount of data the service has to store.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"transport-layer-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#transport-layer-5\"></a>Transport Layer</h3>\n<p>Any privacy-focused mechanism needs to get around the fact that the public Internet is VERY VERY public.</p>\n<p>Obviously, we cannot have clients make a TCP tunnel directly to the service.</p>\n<p>We can consider the use of Tor.  However, Tor emulates a TCP tunnel.  If a client makes multiple requests over the same TCP-over-Tor tunnel, the service can correlate them as coming from the same client.  Thus, the client really needs to create a TCP-over-Tor tunnel, send a single request, then close it.  It is also strongly recommended that the client change circuits between requests, in case it turns out to be the only user of a specific exit node.</p>\n<p>An alternative is something that we already built: the Lightning Network Onion Messages system.</p>\n<p>Onion messages can include a <code>reply_path</code>, which makes it very nice for request-response type of operations.  Generally, onion messages can be sent only over actual published channels (otherwise the client has no idea whether two nodes on the network have a connection between them).  This limits the number of ways by which a service could potentially be contacted, reducing the ability of the service to \u201cbin\u201d clients.  A client with an up-to-date gossip map (using some kind of semi-trusted fast gossip sync) can generate multiple circuits to the service by which it can distribute its interactions with the service, further reducing the ability to \u201cbin\u201d clients.</p>\n<p>An LN client that has only a single channel to a single LSP, and which uses this key-value store service on the same LSP, can send out OMs over that single channel, cycle it through some nodes, and then route it back to the LSP.</p>\n<p>An issue is that LN OM are currently targeted only for BOLT12 invoice requests, which are expected to be low-bandwidth.  For large-scale data storage as proposed here, that assumption would be tested.  Nevertheless, it seems to me that the LN OM system is better here than OHTTP or Tor: OHTTP has only a single hop (laughably insufficient for privacy) while Tor has a persistent TCP tunnel instead of request-response messages (and a client can have the response sent over a different path than the request, via <code>reply_path</code>).</p>",
