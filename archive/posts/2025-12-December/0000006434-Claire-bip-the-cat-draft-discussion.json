He responded to me on the <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Q6ulQb13okg/m/khU9PL1RCwAJ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Bitcoin Development Mailing List (link to discussion here)</a> and for some reason several other replies have been published but my response to him has not. I don\u2019t know if that venue is continuing to censor me but it sure feels like it (I responded on December 11th, since then Greg has had 3 replies approved).</p>\n<p>I am thankful that this forum exists as perhaps a more fair place for discussions about contentious issues.</p>\n<p>My reply follows:</p>\n<p>Hi Greg, thank you for the response.</p>\n<p>When you say I misunderstood your quote, are you referring to the notion that you thought we should try to shape behavior? You also said your reason for caring about motivation in the first place was because you didn\u2019t want to give the wrong impression about what was \u201ckosher\u201d. Both you and Sipa (who also stated in that thread \u201cThe problem is that people may see this as a legitimization of the storage in the first place, and encourage doing so even more.\u201d ) seemed to be primarily motivated by the social signals that would be sent by allowing even a small amount of data to be used arbitrarily in the protocol, but felt (from my reading) that it may be worth the trade-off for, as you said, shaping users to more conservative needs.</p>\n<p>I certainly appreciate your larger point here, where you state that current use has nullified previously effective means of curbing this behavior, and as you say, sometimes even further increasing it. This is precisely why my proposal exists as it does. It acknowledges that these attempts to \u201cstop\u201d the behavior are not effective against strong financial incentives to overcome them. They would also eventually lead to more harmful abuse; typically this filter discussion lands at the threat of fake pubkey use, which has generally been seen as the most harmful way to include data in the system.</p>\n<p>My proposal attempts to destroy trust in those markets, to reduce the desire to spam in the first place.</p>\n<p>\"Were such a proposal seriously advanced it would likely cause a new flood of transactions both to move to evade it directly and as a result of NFT indexer changes to just \u201cwormhole\u201d the tokens to new outputs after the fact (and a new marketing opportunity for the NFT gifters). NFTs are just an imaginary parallel world that don\u2019t depend on the network to validate their activity, so they don\u2019t really care about the network\u2019s rules, and as such the network\u2019s rules have pretty limited effect. \"</p>\n<p>I understand why you feel that way, but this is not the only way to look at it, and I\u2019m glad we\u2019re able to have this discussion.

You\u2019re right: every crypto asset is essentially a narrative.</p>\n<p>Where I feel you don\u2019t give me enough credit is when you dismiss that the buyers of those narratives are apathetic towards them. One of the largest debates in the ordinal world was the value that the actual numbering system should have at all. The entire point of ordinal theory is that they number and value specific satoshi as non-fungible assets themselves. To suggest that they would be content to assign a new satoshi with their key, I think, underestimates how sentimental they are about their rules. It may seem like a silly delusion, but they obviously value them or they wouldn\u2019t spend so much on them.</p>\n<p>\"The proposed gain is some negligible one time reduction in utxo disk space.

I have been under the impression that bloat to the live state (chainstate) is one of the most harmful aspects of things like the fakepubkey threat.
