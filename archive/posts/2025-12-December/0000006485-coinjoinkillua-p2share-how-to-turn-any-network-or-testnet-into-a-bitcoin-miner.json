It is a short-lived Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based layer-1 blockchain solely for the purpose of producing bitcoin blocks. It decentralizes *share accounting* and *payout*, in addition to transaction selection.\n\n# Why?\n\nBitcoin's long block time (10 minutes) introduces revenue variance for miners that can only be overcome by being a larger and larger miner. For this reason Mining Pools have come into existence to pool hashrate from different miners to reduce their variance. This directly impacts the decentralization of the bitcoin network since pools want to maximize their hashrate to minimize their variance, but cannot get bigger than 51% or they are perceived as an attack risk on Bitcoin. A centralized pool \"looks like\" an individual miner with respect to the Bitcoin network.\n\nBraidpool aims to decouple the problems of transaction selection, variance reduction, device monitoring, and mining payout in order to enhance the businesses of both pools and individual miners.\n\n# What does Braidpool mean for existing pools?\n\nExisting pools can run *on top* of Braidpool at no cost to them (Braidpool will be zero-fee) and we encourage them to do so. Doing this allows pools to decouple themselves from two unwinnable games:\n\n**Variance reduction**:\n    Pools can only reduce revenue variance by being big, but being big makes them an attack risk to a decentralized network, and a single point of control for hostile governments. The 51% attack risk still exists but is transferred to Braidpool itself. By having many miners acting individually in Braidpool instead of the pool appearing as one big miner, the risk of a 51% is substantially reduced. It would be safer if all miners operated on top of Braidpool, as long as no single miner has more than 51% of the hashrate. It's also safe for a buyer of shares to buy more than 51% of the shares without becoming a risk to decentralization.\n\n**Transaction selection**:\n    Pools are commonly accused of censoring transactions and constantly fight a PR battle over it. By leaving this responsibility to individual miners, transaction selection is decentralized. Block template construction is not outsourced as it is on Ethereum, which has resulted in more centralization around MEV-boosting traders and \"compliant\" blocks which are antithetical to Bitcoin.\n\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n  This file has been truncated. <a href=\"https://github.com/braidpool/braidpool/blob/8d3c5198593d691f50ae5238cdaee215f4213cda/docs/overview.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">show original</a>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n",
