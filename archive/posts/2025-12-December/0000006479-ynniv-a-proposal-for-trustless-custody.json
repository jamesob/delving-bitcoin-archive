Transactions take much longer than card payments. Small amounts are buried in transaction fees. Functionality is limited by what the game theory supports. There are many proposed solutions, each making different shapes of compromise. Most require various amounts of trust, some require availability, give up privacy, or require opcodes that haven\u2019t found consensus. I\u2019d like to focus on one that\u2019s generally overlooked: custodial Lightning.</p>\n<p>Custodial Lightning has great UX. It\u2019s cheap, it\u2019s fast, it works today. Everyone seems to agree that it\u2019s a beautiful solution \u2026 except for the trust aspect. You have to trust the custodian fully. The only defenses against dishonesty are reputational harm and the court system. Most people agree that this is so fundamentally counter to the value of Bitcoin that they don\u2019t see it as a solution at all. Paper Bitcoin, at best.</p>\n<p>At this point some propose incremntally improving the situation by adding privacy in the form of blinded tokens. Ecash undeniably improves the privacy of custodial systems, but as it doesn\u2019t also address unavoidable trust it\u2019s easy to see why victory hasn\u2019t been declared. There are other potential improvements for reducing this trust, but fundamentally the mechanism of ecash prevents a fully trustless system from ever being achieved. One point that has been top of mind for me is that the privacy of ecash prevents trustless transferrability, thus requiring honest mints to operate forever. Over time the expected value of all ecash tokens trends to zero.</p>\n<p>Taking a step back, what are the sources of trust in custodial Lightning, and can we do anything about them?</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6479-transparency-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6479-transparency-2\"></a>Transparency</h3>\n<p>Always the first thing that comes to mind, a trustless custodian must be auditable. Cryptographic ledgers are a well trodden solution to this: if every update is well formed and signed by the custodian, others can verify that the ledger itself is honest. We\u2019re all familiar with nodes validating the base chain updates published by miners.  The second half is proving reserves. Without sufficient funds, even a well formed ledger is dishonest. We commit funds together with an update hash and have all the information necessary to verify instead of trusting the honesty of a ledger.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6479-accountability-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6479-accountability-3\"></a>Accountability</h3>\n<p>To incentivize custodians to be honest, we need some way to hold them accountable. Bitcoin does this by holding their block rewards hostage: if a miner produces a block that isn\u2019t consensus valid, someone else gets the reward. For Deposits I propose that custodians post collateral exceeding the ledger reserves across many channels with different partners. By putting this collateral at risk of confiscation, the protocol increases the number of parties that must collude in order to make theft profitable. And since collution should also be visible and proveable, the funds at risk grows linear to the number of parties involved. With appropriate collateral ratios and reasonable honest-participant levels, profitable theft in a well connected graph can be extremely difficult.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6479-recovery-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6479-recovery-4\"></a>Recovery</h3>\n<p>Perhaps the most novel, and thus surprising, aspect of the protocol is recovery.

Deposits was explicitly designed to avoid unilateral exit, promising only that funds will remain available in the system. This and the reliance on Lightning are why I am calling it a layer 3.</p>\n<p>As part of holding custodians accountable, partners are able to confiscate funds. This is done by moving reserves to a separate output on the commitment transaction that spends to a multisig of partners with which a custodian is keeping collateral. In the event of unilateral close, the multisig will vote (visibily and undeniably) on whether the funds landing on the chain are correct for the ledger hash that accompanies them. Voters synchronize ledger updates amongst themselves and validate whether the chain ending in this hash is conforming or not. If yes, they vote to restore the funds and ledger to the custodian. If not, they vote to reassign both ledger and reserves. Vote honestly, and everyone agrees. Vote dishonestly, and a voter finds their own channels closed and collateral put up for judgement.</p>\n<p>It is therefore critical that we have transparent accounts.

The protocol enables operators to manage user deposits while being constrained by cryptographic rules enforced at the Lightning channel level.\n\n### Why This Design?\n\nTraditional custodial wallets require users to fully trust the operator. Bitcoin Deposits solves this through:\n\n1. **Economic Constraints**: Operators must lock up 200% of deposits (100% reserves + 100% collateral), making theft economically irrational\n2. **Cryptographic Accountability**: Every operation is signed and hash-chained, creating unforgeable audit trails\n3. **Multi-Party Watching**: Channel partners and collateral partners independently validate operations\n4. **Automatic Recovery**: Time-locked mechanisms ensure funds are never permanently stuck\n\nThe result: a wallet service where operators **can't** steal, not just **won't** steal.\n\n---\n\n## Core Systems\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n  This file has been truncated. <a href=\"https://github.com/ynniv/deposits/blob/60593299f2bd638712b2c9858d6d3e99c9c0c0bc/WHITEPAPER.md\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">show original</a>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n",
