  "raw": "There's a [new paper](https://x.com/hashdag/status/1933544298810622335) that shows how the world's A.I. compute based on matrix multiplication can be used as if that compute power is a \"parent coin\" to \"merge mine\" a blockchain coin. They found a way for matrix multiplications to not be restricted in their size and yet easily prove how many \"FLOPs\" were spent.
