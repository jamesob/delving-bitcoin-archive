Today, ec2 prices don\u2019t seem much different, and node counts aren\u2019t much higher, so at current prices, paying for relay would be closer to 0.01sat/vb. A rate of 0.1sat/vb would cover growing the node count to 1M nodes, and 1sat/vb would cover growing the node count to 10M nodes. So from a \u201cfree relay\u201d perspective, I think 0.1 sat/vb is likely fine, both for min-fee and min-incremental-fee. If the p2p network grows to much more than 1M nodes, that might not be true though.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Curious whether others have thoughts on how the minimum feerates are used, what the minimum feerate should be, how to formalize this, what wallets/applications are using, etc.</p>",
