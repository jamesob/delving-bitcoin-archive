While Block's engineering blog [post](https://engineering.block.xyz/blog/augur-an-open-source-bitcoin-fee-estimation-library) covers the broader motivations behind the project, we wanted to share some technical details here - what we built, how it works, how it performs, and what's next.\n\n## What We Built\n\n**Augur** is a mempool-based Bitcoin fee estimator designed to generate real-time fee recommendations across a range of confirmation targets and confidence levels.\n\nHighlights:\n\n* **Mempool-driven:** Estimation relies on live mempool data, not historical block data.  \n* **Reference implementation:** A starter Kotlin [package](https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur-reference) is available for developers.  \n* **Public API endpoint:** You can query live fee estimates, updated every 30 seconds, at  \n    [`https://pricing.bitcoin.block.xyz/fees`](https://pricing.bitcoin.block.xyz/fees)\n\nHere's a sample response from the API:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"estimates\": {\n    \"6\": {\n      \"probabilities\": {\n        \"0.50\": { \"fee_rate\": 2.1135 },\n        \"0.80\": { \"fee_rate\": 4.0277 },\n        \"0.95\": { \"fee_rate\": 6.008 }\n      }\n    },\n    \"144\": {\n      \"probabilities\": {\n        \"0.50\": { \"fee_rate\": 1.0101 },\n        \"0.80\": { \"fee_rate\": 1.0202 },\n        \"0.95\": { \"fee_rate\": 1.1052 }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  \"mempool_update_time\": \"2025-05-27T16:09:18.461Z\"\n}\n```\n\nInterpretation Example: *If I pay 1.1052 sat/vB in fees, then I can be 95% confident that my transaction will be confirmed within 144 blocks.*\n\n## How It Works\n\nAugur builds on the mempool-first approach popularized by @FelixWeis in [WhatTheFee](https://whatthefee.io). Unlike Bitcoin Core that models fee dynamics based on past blocks, Augur considers the current mempool state, transaction arrival rates, and the inherent randomness of Bitcoin mining.\n\n* Current mempool weight: Transactions grouped by fee rate into buckets, tracking total weight at each fee level.  \n* Transaction inflow rates: Measured over both short (30 min) and long (24 hr) windows to capture recent market dynamics.  \n* Block production probability: Statistical modeling of how many blocks will likely be found in your target timeframe using a Poisson distribution.\n\nWe took the original WhatTheFee [source code](https://github.com/FelixWeis/WhatTheFee--legacy) and re-engineered it into a **production-ready Kotlin library**\u2014a somewhat unconventional but practical choice, since much of our internal infrastructure runs on Kotlin. In the process, we changed to updating mempool snapshots and estimates continuously as opposed to just after a new block is mined. We also implemented JetBrains' [viktor](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/viktor) for faster numerical array operations.\n\n## How We Measured It\n\nWe developed a **custom benchmarking tool** to evaluate Augur's accuracy and cost-effectiveness against other major fee estimators.

Augur, by contrast, struck a better balance between reliability and cost, delivering acceptable success rates at roughly **1/4 the cost**.\n\n\n## What's Next\n\nWe're building an **open-source version** of our benchmarking tool to enable the community to:\n\n* Reproduce our performance metrics  \n* Backtest other fee estimators using historical fee provider data  \n* Contribute improvements to Augur or build their own estimators\n\nWe'll share the benchmarking tool here once it's ready. In the meantime, feel free to check out [Augur](https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur) and its [reference implementation](https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur-reference). @zpv and I welcome any questions or feedback in our posts and repos.\n\n## Addendum\nIn our original post we discussed our benchmarking results against various providers and we incorrectly used the label \"Blockstream (Bitcoin Core)\" instead of \"Blockstream\". To clarify, we used the publicly available Blockstream API when retrieving fee estimates and we can't speak to the underlying algorithms or versions that provide these estimates.\n\nWe did not explicitly benchmark Augur against Bitcoin Core but we would like to do that, time permitting, in the future, and add it to our [open-source benchmarking tool](https://github.com/block/bitcoin-augur-benchmarking) that is now available.
