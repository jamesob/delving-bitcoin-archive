However, we aim to keep it simple so that it serves as a clear example of BitVMX\u2019s capabilities and how it can be integrated as a subcomponent of other Bitcoin protocols. In this example, BitVMX is used to handle state revocations and enable efficient watchtowers that store only O(1) data per payment channel.</p>\n<p>Each state of our toy payment channel has a sequence number <em>i</em>, which increments with every state update. When the parties agree to move to the next state (e.g., rebalance the shared account), they must co-sign three transactions. They can use a multisig or MuSig2 scheme to reduce the on-chain footprint. Then, they create two revocation messages\u2014one for each party\u2014signed with Schnorr signatures. A revocation message contains the new state sequence number <em>i</em> and represents the message: \u201cI revoke all states prior to <em>i</em>.\u201d In practice, the message is simply the number <em>i</em>, signed with a private key designated solely for this purpose.</p>\n<p>When Alice wants to unilaterally close the channel, she can only do so by signing the sequence number <em>i</em> using a one-time signature (OTS) scheme. This sequence number defines the state that Alice claims should determine the final balance distribution between her and Bob. If Alice uses an outdated state\u2014say she signs <em>j</em>, with <em>j &lt; i</em>\u2014a dispute mechanism is triggered to penalize her. Bob simply needs to present the OTS-signed value j and the Schnorr-signed message \u201cI revoke all states prior to <em>i</em>,\u201d which Alice previously issued and which Bob has stored. A Bitcoin script verifies the OTS signature, while a RISC-V program executed via BitVMX verifies the Schnorr signature and checks whether <em>j &lt; i</em>.

Optional auxiliary parties, *Wa* and *Wb*, act as watchtowers for Alice and Bob, respectively.\n\n### Initialization\n\n1. Each owner chooses a hidden pre-image (*Pa* by Alice and *Pb* by Bob) and sends the other the corresponding hash (*Ha = H(Pa)* and *Hb = H(Pb)*).\n2. Each owner generates an OTS key pair (pair *A1* for Alice and *B1* for *Bob*) for signing sequence values *i*, using 32-bit unsigned integers to allow up to 4 billion updates.
