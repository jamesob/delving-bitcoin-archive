<a href=\"http://morehouse.github.io\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">morehouse.github.io</a>, reproduced here to facilitate discussion.</em></p>\n<p>LND 0.18.2 and below are vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack involving repeated gossip requests for the full Lightning Network graph.\nThe attack is trivial to execute and can cause LND to run out of memory (OOM) and crash or hang.\nYou can protect your node by updating to at least <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/releases/tag/v0.18.3-beta\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">LND 0.18.3</a> or by setting <code>ignore-historical-gossip-filters=true</code> in your node configuration.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-5537-background-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5537-background-1\"></a>Background</h1>\n<p>To send payments successfully across the Lightning Network, a node generally needs to have an accurate view of the Lightning Network graph.\nLightning nodes maintain a local copy of the network graph that they continuously update as they receive channel and node updates from their peers via a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gossip_protocol\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">gossip protocol</a>.</p>\n<p>New nodes and nodes that have been offline for a while need a way to bootstrap their local copy of the network graph.\nA common way this is done is to send a <a href=\"https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/6c5968ab83cee68683b4e11dc889b5982a2231e9/07-routing-gossip.md#the-gossip_timestamp_filter-message\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><code>gossip_timestamp_filter</code></a> message to some of the node\u2019s peers, requesting that they share all gossip messages they have that are newer than a certain timestamp.\nNodes that cooperate with the message will load the requested gossip from their databases and send them to the requesting peer.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-5537-the-vulnerability-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5537-the-vulnerability-2\"></a>The Vulnerability</h1>\n<p>By default, LND cooperates with all <code>gossip_timestamp_filter</code> requests.\nPrior to v0.18.3, LND\u2019s <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/blob/9380292a5a41697640c2284186c82dad6f7b004f/discovery/syncer.go#L1317-L1384\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">logic</a> to respond to these requests looks like this:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"go\"><code class=\"lang-go\">func RespondGossipFilter(filter *GossipTimestampFilter) {\n  gossipMsgs := loadGossipFromDatabase(filter)\n\n  go func() {\n    for msg := range gossipMsgs {\n      sendToPeerSynchronously(msg)\n    }\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>LND loads <em>all</em> requested messages into memory at the same time, and then sends them one by one to the peer, pausing after each send until the peer acknowledges receiving the message.\nThe peer can specify any filter, including one that requests <em>all</em> historical gossip messages to be sent to them, and LND will happily comply with the request.\nAs a result, <strong>LND can load potentially hundreds of thousands of messages into memory for <em>each</em> request</strong>.\nAnd since LND has no limit on the number of concurrent requests it will handle, memory usage can get out of hand quickly.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-5537-the-dos-attack-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5537-the-dos-attack-3\"></a>The DoS Attack</h1>\n<p>Exploiting this vulnerability to DoS attack a victim is easy.\nAn attacker simply needs to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Send lots of <code>gossip_timestamp_filter</code> messages to the victim, setting the timestamp to 0 to request the full graph.</li>\n<li>Keep the connection with the victim open by periodically sending pings and slowly ACKing incoming messages.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This causes LND\u2019s memory consumption to grow over time, until an OOM occurs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-5537-experiment-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5537-experiment-4\"></a>Experiment</h2>\n<p>I carried out this DoS attack against an LND node with 8 GB of RAM and 2 GB of swap.\nAfter a few minutes, the node exhausted its RAM and started using swap, and LND\u2019s performance slowed to a crawl.\nAfter about 2 hours, LND exhausted the swap as well and the operating system killed the LND process.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-5537-the-mitigation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5537-the-mitigation-5\"></a>The Mitigation</h1>\n<p>LND 0.18.3 added a <a href=\"https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/commit/013452cff0788289aae3aa296242c698c9beff9d#diff-fd66292d846960a30b8ff5e63dbf15b846fdb6b55afe6dde63c8c2ebca66674dL22-L513\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">global semaphore</a> to limit the number of concurrent <code>gossip_timestamp_filter</code> requests that LND will cooperate with.\nWhile this doesn\u2019t fix LND\u2019s excessive memory usage per request, it does limit the global impact on memory usage, which is enough to protect against this DoS attack.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-5537-discovery-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-5537-discovery-6\"></a>Discovery</h1>\n<p>This vulnerability was discovered while looking at how LND handles various peer messages.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-5537-timeline-7\" class=\"anchor\"

developers were more focused on building features and shipping quickly in the early days of the Lightning Network, I think it is long overdue that a shift is made to more careful
