Some users are curious why this limit exists and have expressed interest in longer timelocks. I\u2019ve been experimenting with an idea to extend timelocks and would love your thoughts\u2014*not* advocating for a soft fork, just exploring the concept to gauge its feasibility and implications.\n\n## Context and Experiment\nI looked into extending relative timelocks to ~10 years by:\n- Using bit 21 in `nSequence` to signal a \"long\" timelock.\n- If bit 21 is set and bit 22 is unset, the timelock unit is interpreted as 8 blocks, multiplying the duration by 8.\n- This seems to require minimal changes to Bitcoin Core (though I\u2019m not deeply familiar with the Core codebase, so I could be missing complexities). It would be a soft fork, as older nodes would ignore the flag and enforce a timelock 8 times shorter.\n\nI also created a tool to craft addresses and transactions for a simple \"anyone can spend after timelock\" policy to test this. you can check out the experimental code and tool here:\n- Code change: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/commit/a9187117ccf7224297a74f3dfebc2354ad9fe6e2\n- Tool: https://github.com/pythcoiner/csv2\n\n## Discussion Points\n- **Use cases**: Are there compelling use cases for ~10-years timelocks?\n- **Risks**: What risks or edge cases might arise?
