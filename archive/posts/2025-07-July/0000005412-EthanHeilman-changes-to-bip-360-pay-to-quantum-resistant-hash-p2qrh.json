P2QRH outputs commit directly to the tapleaf merkle root computed by taproot.\n\nThe scriptPubKey for a P2QRH output is:\n\nOP_PUSHNUM_3 OP_PUSHBYTES_32 <tapleaf merkle root>\n\nAdvantages of this approach\n\n1. We can reuse taproot code, but just skip taptweak steps.\n2. Everyone who understands P2TR, already understands P2QRH.\n3. By supporting tapscript and tapleaf, it supports everything that supports tapscript.\n4. P2QRH protects tapscript outputs against long-exposure attacks. This is a big win because long-exposure attacks will be practical before short-exposure attacks. Note: protecting against short-exposure attacks requires PQ signatures.\n5. P2QRH gives us similar functionality as the much discussed option of disabling key-spends in P2TR on Q-Day (when quantum attacks become practical), but with the added benefit that the ecosystem can upgrade well before Q-Day. This removes the risks of attempting a consensus change during an emergency or acting too late.\n\nWe moved PQ signatures specification out of BIP-360 so that P2QRH can be debated independently of the debate over PQ signature algorithms. This allows us to move forward on P2QRH without forcing a commitment to any particular algorithm.\n\nBIP-360 includes a purely informational plan for adding PQ signature algorithms to tapscript.
