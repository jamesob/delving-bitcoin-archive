In your message you push back against my characterization of Bitcoin Core users being all Bitcoin users, and argue end users running full nodes are key to the security of the network and therefore making this more accessible should be a priority of the Core project.</p>\n<p>With regard to the former, it seems pretty clear all users of Bitcoin are indirectly affected by the quality of the Bitcoin software. I don\u2019t think users interacting directly with the software should be prioritized over those interacting with the network in a different manner. You could even stretch this to say all Bitcoin users are Core users, only some use the private RPC interface and others the public P2P interface. Instead of basing priorities on how users interface with the software i think we should consider stakes. The Core GUI is potentially important to a handful of non-technical users to be able to use Bitcoin at all. The Core wallet is potentially <em>very</em> important to a non-trivial share of Bitcoin users, whether to make payments (6% of all transactions nowadays may be crafted by the Core wallet<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#footnote-4400-1\" id=\"footnote-ref-4400-1\">[1]</a></sup>) or to store value (as the oldest wallet and probably the one with the strongest compatibility guarantees). The Core node is critically important to every single Bitcoin user. Given the size of the network today, it\u2019s pretty clear the stakes for the Core node are so high as to dwarf those of the two other components. This is <em>not</em> to say the wallet and GUI are not important.
