At present, only channel topology and routing fees are shared to nodes on the network via the gossip protocol. Channel balance, however, is not shared with the network.

Finally, nodes must constantly sync the current state of the network, and even then, may not have the benefit of historical data to inform them of channel reliability.\n\nAt it's root, these issues stem from the source node's dependence on received gossip data. The gossip protocol works by flooding the network to ensure everyone receives each message.
