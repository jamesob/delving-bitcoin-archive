Then privacy could easily be achieved, without leaving the bitcoin ecosystem, via atomic swaps between mainchain btc and the sharechain.\n\nThe problem I am currently unable to solve (which is why I post it here in case anyone here knows how):\n\n**In a MW-like sharechain network, how can we pseudorandom-uniformly select a shareholder's public key?**\n\nSelection of the public key of a random shareholder (weighted by number of shares) is easy in a UTXO system like bitcoin's where amounts are publicly associated with UTXOs. This was demonstrated in the above p2share writeup. However, recovering this criteria for a sharechain with MW-like semantics, without stripping MW of its privacy benefits, is non-trivial.\n\n**EDIT: for MW-like semantics, I believe the answer to this is \"no.\"** However we could perhaps imagine a sharechain with consensus rules such that each transaction output is required to be of equal amount, and coinbases are required to also have multiple outputs, each of equal amount.
