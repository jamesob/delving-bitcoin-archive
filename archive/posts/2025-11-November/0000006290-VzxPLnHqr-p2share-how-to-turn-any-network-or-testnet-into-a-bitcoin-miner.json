What to do about spam on the sharechain?\n\n    Given that shares are long-lived just like regular bitcoin, a sharechain may suffer and have to overcome similar challenges that Bitcoin has to overcome. \n\n    The good news is that, by design, these p2share sharechains can themselves serve as testing grounds for trying out anti-spam mechanisms which are acceptable to the sharechain nodes.\n\n    A sharechain with a track record of reckless features requiring hard-forks (of the sharechain) to fix might appeal to some, but not others. Whichever is the case, we can expect it will be reflected in the price (in sats), if any, that people are willing to pay to atomically swap in/out of those shares.\n\n    A sharechain with a track record of pushing Bitcoin forward in a consistent fashion may experience some level of price stability and market liquidity for its shares. In other words, a sharechain which is consistently a good steward to its shareholders and to Bitcoin may enjoy a price premium for its shares relative to other sharechains.\n\n4. What about ephemeral, purely speculative, sharechains?\n    \n    Why not? It is still Bitcoin mining and therefore still has real costs. Maybe the speculative sharechain is trying to explore a cutting edge feature and has no other way to do it and wants to remain within the Bitcoin ecosystem? Or maybe the people doing it are crazy. I suppose we can here speculate ourselves that the shares of such sharechains will be nearly, if not entirely, worthless -- until when/if they are somehow not.\n\n5. Sharechain mergers?\n\n    Suppose a speculative or otherwise ephemeral sharechain ends up demonstrating a feature which may be valuable to other sharechains?\n\n    So long as the units of work are compatible, then it feels like it may be possible for one sharechain to absorb another (i.e. for the absorbing chain to hard-fork and recognize the work/shares of the absorbed chain). \n\n   Perhaps as part of the contemplated merger, the developers of the feature(s) of the speculative sharechain provide/backport an implementation of the feature(s) to the absorbing chain _and_ the merger is contingent upon the activation of that feature.\n\n   Feels like a logistical nightmare, but still might be doable.
