The original post presented a less generalized version of p2share but where the share issuance was more similar to Bitcoin\u2019s (shrinking-pie model).

Then, to confuse things more, I presented the most general version where the \u201cparameters\u201d (shape of the share issuance schedule, block time, difficulty adjustment algorithm, etc) can all be fine tuned.</p>\n<p>Now, to get on the same page with regard to nomenclature, when I refer to \u201cshares\u201d I am here referring to the sharechain\u2019s unit of account. You can imagine a sharechain as its own network which operates similar to bitcoin, and just like bitcoin has output amounts (sats) in its utxos, a sharechain has output amounts (shares) in its utxos.</p>\n<p>Due to the \u201cselect a random shareholder\u201d mechanism of p2share, <em>unlike</em> bitcoin itself, these shares possess an equity-like property that we might associate with more traditional for-profit enterprises.
