Whether that be a real estate agent that doesn\u2019t really care about getting basic repairs done promptly, or a CEO who\u2019s more interested in getting big bonuses versus building the company for the long term.</p>\n<p>Apart from the agency problem, passive investments will otherwise end up with underutilised real assets: property that\u2019s underdeveloped or underutilised, art that\u2019s kept locked away as an investment rather than displayed, commodities that are sitting in a vault rather than being used in production or as consumer goods, etc.</p>\n<p>And what happens if passive investors suddenly exit the market for all those goods? Demand decreases, and so do prices: making it cheaper to buy a home instead of renting, cheaper to own a controlling interest in a company rather than a small percentage of shares, cheaper to retain ownership and control of a company you built rather than selling it off or more affordable to get promoted from an employee to a partner in a business, cheaper to buy consumables and capital for your business, and thus cheaper to produce consumer goods. All good things!</p>\n<p>So why don\u2019t passive investors exit the market for all those goods? Because their alternative is sitting on cash, which is designed to lose value slowly over time even in the normal case, and regularly loses value in large jumps due to government mismanagement.</p>\n<p>The only way that doesn\u2019t happen is if the value of holding cash over time is more than the value of holding real assets over time: if you can buy an empty plot of land today for $100,000, do nothing, and in ten years expect to sell it for $200,000 (about 7% pa), you\u2019d be a fool to sit on your money; but if in ten years it would only sell for $90,000 (about -1% pa), sitting on your money doesn\u2019t look so bad.</p>\n<p>Of course, in either case, if you were actively investing, then spending $100,000 to buy the land, and $50,000 to develop it, might then net you $20,000 pa in profit from renting it out, which leaves you with a net profit of $50,000 after ten years, even ignoring whatever the residual value of the asset ends up being. So active investment is still worthwhile even in a deflationary environment.</p>\n<p>Likewise it doesn\u2019t mean every good will be immediately consumed by business: if businesses expect they can sell 1000 units of some commodity today for $100, or could sell 50 units today for $80 and the remaining 50 units in a decade for $70 then it still makes sense to preserve the goods rather than selling them immediately.</p>\n<p>So might a deflationary currency \u2013 like Bitcoin with its fixed supply \u2013 not be such a scary idea after all?</p>\n<p>There are, still, two meaningful potential downsides to a regime other than \u201ccontrolled low inflation in the 2%-3% range\u201d.</p>\n<p>The first is that governments can\u2019t trivially fund projects by printing money. However this is largely incompatible with \u201ccontrolled low inflation\u201d anyway \u2013 either only covering a small fraction of government projects (perhaps 20% of federal government spending in Australia, eg), or funding insurance programs where inflation will be out of control if the event being insured against eventuates (eg insuring deposits in the banking system), or creating a hyperinflationary cycle. So for the cases where the scheme is compatible with the goal of controlled low inflation, funding seems likely to be relatively easily replaced by some other model (taxes or borrowing).</p>\n<p>The second is that a deflationary currency might not be very predictable. People\u2019s preference between saving for the future versus enjoying in the present isn\u2019t constant, even averaged across an entire country. If \u201cconsumer confidence\u201d goes down, people may prefer to save rather than spend, driving the relative value of the things they consider \u201csaving\u201d up, and the value of the things they consider \u201cconsumables\u201d down. With an inflationary fiat currency, central banks can recognise this behaviour, and tweak the money supply and interest rates, so that wages and the average cost of consumables continues to rise slowly, and almost all of the volatility in prices is confined to things like real estate, and the stock market. With a fixed, deflationary currency that is heavily used for saving, however, the pricing volatility will naturally hit both consumer goods and the labor market: forcing businesses to mark down their goods, and then either fire or cut the salaries of their employees. After all, firing necessary employees because they won\u2019t accept a necessary cut in wages will damage the business; but being willing to accept a wage cut just because the employer claims it\u2019s necessary will result in never earning what you\u2019re worth. So (contrary to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajtowns/status/1555784636927655937\">what I wrote in the tweet thread</a>) this does seem like a legitimate way that a responsibly managed fiat currency can reduce or avoid recessions.</p>\n<p>But this also seems to me like a real case where central banks economists and financial engineers have a meaningful future, even in an all Bitcoin future. The central bank could, for instance, issue an inflationary currency backed by deflationary one \u2013 if you say $10,000 today is worth 0.5 BTC, and inflate the dollar while deflating BTC, you end up with, perhaps $10,250 in a year being worth 0.495 BTC. But of course that\u2019s only if it\u2019s reliable \u2013 if BTC becomes inflationary (due to the savings rate dropping massively), perhaps your $10,250 requires 0.525 BTC to back it, and you\u2019re screwed. But if everyone is really interested in holding BTC anyway, the central bank doesn\u2019t actually need to issue a token \u2013 all it really needs to do is release an exchange rate. 1 BTC = $20,000 today, 1 BTC = $20707 in a year, 1 BTC = $19,523 when the savings rate plummets. Wages and goods can then be priced in dollars, but paid in BTC, with no one actually holding dollars, and no one suffering a risk of a bank run due to holding dollars that are suddenly unbacked.</p>\n<p>That system would have some strange behaviours (if it is even possible to implement in the real world). In particular, a rise in the \u201csavings rate\u201d, once reflected in the changing exchange rate of the dollar, would, in dollar terms, immediately increase the value of everyone\u2019s savings, presumably to the point where, again in dollar terms, everyone is still willing to buy roughly as many goods and services as they were previously (avoding a drop in GDP and a recession). However in bitcoin terms, the new exchange rate and their wages/income being fixed in dollar terms, would mean that they receive less BTC every month, making it harder to continue to grow their savings in percentage terms. Perhaps that simply means that if the desire for savings increases again, then the central bank will adapt by again decreasing the exchange rate, and everyone will be satisfied, but it\u2019s not clear to me that there wouldn\u2019t be some more complicated result.</p>\n<p>In any event, the key issue there is simply one of collective bargaining: businesses and workers and consumers agree to coordinate automatic mild price cuts (in BTC terms) via their national central bank for both wages and goods. In all cases they can opt out of this, either by changing their prices or by renegotiating their salary; but in the normal case, (if it\u2019s workable) it provides an easy way to address bumps in the economy in a way that, hopefully, affects everyone equally.</p>",
