  "raw": "Zawy used a constant 'a' in his simulations but in my simulations and in practice 'a' is measured by the average \"width\" of the DAG: Nb/Nc which is the ratio of beads (share-chain blocks) to the number of total-ordered consensus \"cuts\" in the graph (aka \"cohorts\"). @sipa this is exactly a difficulty adjustment based on \"blocks not in the main chain\", I'm just using some more graph theory to describe the same concept.
