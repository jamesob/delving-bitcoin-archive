This PR fixes that and also adds a test.\n\nThe non-test changes in the last commit should be in v28, otherwise miners have to patch it themselves. If necessary I can split that out into a separate PR, but I prefer to get the tests in as well.\n\nIn order to add the test, we activate BIP94 on regtest.\n\nIn order for the test to run faster, we reduce its difficulty retarget period to 144, the same number that's already used for softfork activation logic. Regtest does not actually adjust its difficulty, so this change has no effect (except for `getnetworkhashps`, see commit).\n\nAn alternative approach would be to run this test on testnet4, by hardcoding its first 2015 in the test suite. But since the timewarp mitigation is a serious candidate for a future mainnet softfork, it seems better to just deploy it on regtest.\n\nThe next commits add a test and fix the miner code.\n\nThe `MAX_TIMEWARP` constant is moved to `consensus.h` so both validation and miner code have access to it.</span></p>\n  </div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>The main change adds this to miner.cpp:</p>\n<pre data-code-wrap=\"cpp\"><code class=\"lang-cpp\">if (consensusParams.enforce_BIP94) {\n        // Height of block to be mined.\n        const int height{pindexPrev-&gt;nHeight + 1};\n        if (height % consensusParams.DifficultyAdjustmentInterval() == 0) {\n            nNewTime = std::max&lt;int64_t&gt;(nNewTime, pindexPrev-&gt;GetBlockTime() - MAX_TIMEWARP);\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The pull request description is focussed on a different scenario, but this (also) fixes the second griefing attack.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"AntoineP\" data-post=\"16\" data-topic=\"1326\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/user_avatar/delvingbitcoin.org/antoinep/48/483_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> AntoineP:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Assuming you are still proposing to use 150 minutes instead, could you provide an argument for why this value would possibly better accommodate broken software we do not know about?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Yes, 150 minutes makes the above griefing attack on broken miner software impossible, because the attacker can\u2019t put their timestamp more than 120 minutes in the future.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group quote-modified\" data-username=\"AntoineP\" data-post=\"16\" data-topic=\"1326\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/user_avatar/delvingbitcoin.org/antoinep/48/483_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> AntoineP:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"sjors\" data-post=\"14\" data-topic=\"1326\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/user_avatar/delvingbitcoin.org/sjors/48/59_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> sjors:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The timewarp fix with a 600 second limit deviates from that because it requires miners to also check their entire stack of mining software.
