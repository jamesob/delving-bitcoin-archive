  "raw": "Let's say $c_i$ is the actual time at which block $i$ is found, and $t_i$ is its timestamp.\n\nIf the attacker (who is assumed to have 100% hashrate) follows this strategy:\n* The first block in every period $p$ uses as timestamp the previous block's timestamp minus the grace period: $t_{2016p} = t_{2016p-1} - G$ (the minimum legal time according to the proposed rule).\n* The 2014 middle blocks use the minimum legal time, which doesn't really matter as long as it's low enough: $t_{2016p+k} = 0$ for $0 < k < 2015$.\n* The final block in the period uses the current time $t_{2016p+2015} = c_{2016p+2015}$.\n\nThen the observed duration of the **2015** blocks in period $p$ (relevant for difficulty adjustment) is $t_{2016p+2015} - t_{2016p} = c_{2016p+2015} - c_{2016p-1} + G$, i.e. the time it took to mine **2016** blocks plus $G$.\n\nThe difficulty multiplier $m$ will thus be $m = \\frac{P}{X + G}$, where $X$ is Erlang distributed with $k=2016$ and $\\lambda=hashrate \\cdot \\frac{target}{2^{256}}$.\n\nIn a simulation with $G=600$ I get an effective average block interval under constant hashrate of 599.9997... seconds. With $G=7200$ I get 596.7211... seconds.",
