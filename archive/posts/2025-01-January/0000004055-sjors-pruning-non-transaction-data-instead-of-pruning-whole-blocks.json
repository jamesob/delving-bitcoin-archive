They have to un-serialize and re-serialize without the witnesses before sending them.\n\nEven though this is a draft, conceptual and approach review is very welcome.\n\n---\n\nTODO:\n\n- [ ] a bunch of tests\n- [ ] edge cases around manually pruned nodes (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419751142)\n- [ ] make sure we are not advertising blocks with witnesses when we in fact do not have the witnesses (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419443888, https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419751142)\n- [ ] edge case when restarting with different assume valid settings (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419751142)\n- [ ] document that it's a change in what constitutes assumevalid (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#issuecomment-1419611954)\n- [ ] always serve pre-segwit blocks straight from disk (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27050#discussion_r1097532417)</span></p>\n  </div>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>content that some node owners might not want to store on their hard drive</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Something you don\u2019t want on your harddrive could be embedded in the non-witness part of a block.
