Let's try to use the game theory for securing the transfers. \n\n### Simple example\n\n- Alice owns UTXO with 10 bitcoin\n- Alice decides to send 1 bitcoin to Bob\n\n| Transaction outputs | Alice | Bob | Punishment Fee |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Status transaction | 9 | 1 | 0 |\n\nIt's a normal transaction that Alice or Bob can broadcast.
