This will not be a definitive proposal as the design is still being iterated upon. Note all the terms to identify concepts are also a WIP, as they should be clear but should not be confused with concepts at lower layers.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m working on a L3 protocol on top of Lightning called <strong>Constellation</strong>. The main goal is to mitigate UX issues seen at the two lower levels, such as non-instant transaction confirmation (L1), rising transaction fees (L1), channel liquidity issues (whether routing or inbound) (L2) and throughput bottlenecks (L1) by making use of various different protocols and technologies either finalised or in active development. All funds on L3 are 1:1 backed by funds held in L2 channels.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"the-complicated-stuff-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-complicated-stuff-1\"></a>the complicated stuff</h2>\n<p>Constellation has a <strong>federated security model that\u2019s enforced via ROAST</strong>, a wrapper around the FROST protocol to create BIP 340 compatible Schnorr signatures. However, unlike other federated scaling layers, <strong>Constellation is a network of multiple, interoperable federations</strong> which settle differences via Lightning. This means that <strong>any trust model is possible</strong> with Constellation. Entities who have the capabilities to run their own nodes and funds to pay for on-chain Lightning channel operations can be fully self-sovereign and self-sufficient. Entities that would prefer not to run their own nodes, likely the majority of people, can opt to choose a federation with a trust model that suits them, nominally a guild consisting of many independent operators.</p>\n<p>These federations are referred to as <strong>guilds</strong>, and the members that they consist of are called <strong>operators</strong>. While guilds can increase their security linearly by adding more (honest) operators, the performance loss scales roughly only logarithmically, due to how L3\u2019s ledgers work.</p>\n<p>Unlike another federated layer like Liquid, operators have individual ledgers and their own underlying Lightning node(s). Constellation\u2019s ledgers are very different from how other ledgers work. They are UTXO-based, like Bitcoin, as opposed to account based. However, a single operator actually operates 2^16 distinct partitions. A given transaction on L3 may be present on multiple partitions, each of which is able to determine a \u201cleader\u201d partition. We exploit the seemingly random nature of hashes, as each input and output will have a random \u201cidentifier\u201d. We can partition transactions using these hashes, to run 65536 interlinked, communicating ledgers per operator.</p>\n<p>As a basic example, we have a transaction A + B \u2192 C + D, where A and B are inputs and C and D are outputs. When received, this transaction will be partitioned based on its inputs - determining the physical CPU core(s) that process the transaction. Upon receiving a transaction, it\u2019s in the unconfirmed state. Let\u2019s say that A and C both are in the same partition, P1 (via this hashing prefix mechanism) and B and D are on different partitions, P2 and P3 respectively. That means we have 3 partitions that this transaction should be present on. Next,  we work out what physical CPU core each of those partitions is on. P1, P2 and P3 may all actually be on the same CPU core. They may be on different CPU cores, even different machines (an operator is enforced to run multiple machines). A CPU core will operate at least one partition - this enables an operator to scale their potential throughput up and down by adding and removing CPU cores.</p>\n<p>One of these partitions is determined as the \u201cleader\u201d of this transaction. The leader is responsible for deciding when a transaction is confirmed. Each partition will only have a subset of the data, either input or output. If P1 is chosen as the leader, it will validate the script of A. P2 and P3 will receive copies of the transaction and P2 will validate the spending script for B. All partitions will persist their copy of the transaction to disk, and P2 and P3 will message P1 when they\u2019ve applied the transaction to their local ledger. Once P1 receives confirmation from the others, it will confirm the transaction in its own ledger and inform the other partitions to confirm it too. Once they all respond confirming the transaction, the transaction is confirmed within a single operator.</p>\n<p>Note that while I say it confirms the transaction, it actually batches these in \u201cblocks\u201d. These blocks are limited in size, but have strict local deadlines of 50\u00b5s. If the size limit is hit before the deadline, the block is sent onwards - else it is sent upon hitting the deadline. Transactions are processed in batches to reduce overhead. Batches moving between partitions during the confirmation stage move in <em>packages</em>, and each partition advances its ledger using batches of transactions called blocks. Once there are transactions that have finished validation, they\u2019ll be put into blocks as fast as they\u2019re required.</p>\n<p>Transactions will often, even mostly, be contained within multiple blocks. When a leader of a partition creates a block, it tells its replicants. The replicants reply when they\u2019ve validated and successfully persisted the block. When the leader hears back from the majority of operators in this replica (note: <em>not</em> majority of replicants), it confirms the block locally and tells the replicants to confirm it, advancing their copies of the partition. Unlike Bitcoin, two blocks at the same \u201cheight\u201d may never be created. There can only possibly be one leader at a time, as it needs a majority of operators to confirm. If the block is invalid, the other operators may reject it and elect a new leader.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say we have a basic 2-of-3 guild (2 operators need to confirm, 3 operators total) made of O1, O2 and O3. Each operator maintains 2^16 partitions. Partitions are replicated twice within every operator, ensured to be on separate machines. Therefore, O1 has 2^17 partitions for itself, 2^17 for replicating O2, and 2^17 for replicating O3. This is the same for every operator. This ensures incredible redundancy against attacks and failures, but makes the time-to-confirm for a transaction longer. Theoretically. Practically, the time-to-confirm still appears near-instant, faster than Lightning even. For a transaction to confirm, it needs all involved partitions to confirm. Each partition is its own state machine, replicated using this modified Raft consensus model. A given partition, for example O1-12345 has <em>2</em>3=6 copies* and <em>1 leader</em>. By default, this leader is operated by O1. If the leader dies, the replica inside O1 should take over. If neither is available, or if the operator is designated as malicious, O2 and O3 will start elect a leader between themselves. As majority holders, they can over-rule O1.</p>\n<p>While complex, this model allows for extremely high transactional throughput. 2^16 leaders per operator mean each operator is limited to the transactional throughput of 65,536 CPU cores.
