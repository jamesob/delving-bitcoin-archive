Presumably any AI-powered economy would be much stronger than one merely human-powered.

There is a reason why consensus N-of-N is so important: it makes even those of great economic power (and we can likely assume that any AI-powered economy <em><strong>WILL</strong></em> be great economically) of equal weight to someone who only has one key in that N-of-N, even if the great economic power can buy out the rest of the keys (whereas a mere k-of-n, a powerful AI needs only buy out k keys).
