Here are some things that I've learned in that process:\n\n* The requirements for a transaction hash are different when committed to in the locking script vs by a signature in the unlock script.\n* For transaction hash covenants, recursion is only possible through deleted key signatures.\n** If the hash commits to an output, there is a hash-loop unless the hash is committed to in the unlock by a deleted key signature.\n** If the hash does not commit to any outputs then it cannot constrain the next spend, no recursion.\n* Single-output, single-input script covenants can be useful to enable fees to be added to covenant constructions\n** Bitcoin does not have transaction sponsors, ephemeral anchors, or fee accounts</code></pre>\n    This file has been truncated. <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/reardencode/2aa98700b720174598d21989dd46e781\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">show original</a>\n\n<p>\n</p>\n\n  </article>\n\n  <div class=\"onebox-metadata\">\n    \n    \n  </div>\n\n  <div style=\"clear: both\"></div>\n</aside>\n\n<p>(I apparently can\u2019t paste the text in here because I\u2019m a new user and it contains links)</p>",
