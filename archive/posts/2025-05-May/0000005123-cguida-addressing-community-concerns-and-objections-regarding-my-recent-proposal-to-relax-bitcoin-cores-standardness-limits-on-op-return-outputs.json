The costs are not \u201cludicrously small\u201d; as a matter of fact, Rob Hamilton tested an attempt to get past the dust filter, and ended up spending <a href=\"https://x.com/Rob1Ham/status/1744540220853268538\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">72 hours and 9x the normal fee</a> to get it confirmed. Obviously since Mara implemented their hostile Slipstream service, the cost to go around mempool filters has come down significantly, but the average cost seems to be <a href=\"https://x.com/SuperTestnet/status/1919852784699990318\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">still around 3x what a normal tx would cost</a>.

Currently only a minority of hashrate (Mara and F2Pool) have \u201cdirect submission\u201d services, because these pools are bad actors. The rest of the hashrate has not implemented these abusive services, because they clearly care about bitcoin being usable as money (which they should if they want to avoid undermining their investment!)</p>\n<p>So what that means is that Mara and F2Pool are increasing their risk of having their blocks orphaned by not following standardness rules. Of course, they are also opening themselves up to retaliatory action, such as boycotts, by angry bitcoiners. All in all, it doesn\u2019t seem worth the risk for a mining pool to attack bitcoin in this way. Anyway they will always end up passing on this additional risk in the form of increased fees to their customers, which means filters will always be effective, as long as a majority of the network runs them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bitcoin Core as a project has always put significant work into addressing mining centralization pressures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, that has always been a stated goal, but it doesn\u2019t seem to be very effective so far. At the moment, there are only a handful of entities creating block templates for the vast majority of hashrate. Maybe instead of kicking the can down the road by caving to scammers\u2019 demands, core should focus on tech to help re-decentralize mining.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So you can build up strawmans and yell at them all you want, i am confident the project will continue to treat this as a primary concern in the interest of all users of the Bitcoin network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What \u201cstrawmen\u201d are you referring to? You\u2019re just projecting. You are completely ignoring all of the points I made, which (as far as I know) are dealing with your actual positions, and not strawmen. Conversely, your points have all attacked strawmen from the anti-spam side, and you have still not dealt with the steelmen. But please point out where I have made errors and I will apologize and retract.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nobody\u2019s proposing to change standardness rules to accommodate Citrea or any other side system</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess I misread your stated rationale then, which <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/d6ZO7gXGYbQ/m/mJyek28lDAAJ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">explicitly mentions Citrea\u2019s new rollup bridge as a motivation</a> for wanting to remove opreturn limits. Yes, of course there may be \u201cother\u201d rollups that try to do a similar thing, but such rollups can also be treated as hostile (because they are).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Their design works fine for them today, with or without your (or my) blessing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It actually doesn\u2019t. If enough people filter their transactions, their entire system falls apart. Currently their txs are considered standard, but there\u2019s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/J9bRVIXOhm0?t=12555\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">no reason why we can\u2019t filter them</a>. The reason they are not relying on hostile private relay services such as Mara or F2Pool is that they need assurances that these transactions will be confirmed in a timely manner and just using one or two small miners is not a good enough guarantee. They need the cooperation of the public relay network to even launch. They need us. We don\u2019t need them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The point is to rectify the perverse incentive to use forever-unspendable outputs unnecessarily created by Core\u2019s standardness rules.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, and you still haven\u2019t addressed my point about this being a fake motivation, given brc20s having added 8GB of utxoset bloat because of core\u2019s failure to merge Luke\u2019s anti-inscription PR. The longer you dance around trying to avoid answering this point, the more dishonest you look.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m aware that you love this strawman so i\u2019m sorry to break it up to you: Citrea\u2019s usage itself has never been the primary concern</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I never claimed this was the primary concern. Citrea was the catalyst, though, and if we respond to such attacks with the hostility they deserve, it\u2019s very unlikely that other similar ventures will follow. Again, they need our cooperation in order for their system to function. We don\u2019t need them - <em>any</em> of them. Bitcoin works just fine without EVM-casino scamcoin rollups.

You don\u2019t see the contradiction in calling Citrea\u2019s usage of fake pubkeys a \u201cperverse incentive\u201d, but somehow letting anyone stuff as much data as they want into the witness, causing a tripling of the utxoset size in 2 years, is <em>not</em> a perverse incentive??
