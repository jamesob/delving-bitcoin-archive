This requires market makers to lock some bitcoin hence it increases the [cost of sybil attack](https://joinmarket.sgn.space/sybilresistance).\n\n[Fidelity bonds](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Fidelity_bonds) were proposed as a [solution](https://gist.github.com/chris-belcher/18ea0e6acdb885a2bfbdee43dcd6b5af) to sybil attacks by [Chris Belcher](https://x.com/chris_belcher_/status/1496577077751001093).\n\n![image|505x492](upload://fDS3IyHgdYoU9zXM7o0t6hlgBMV.jpeg)\n\n## Joinstr\n\nJoinstr uses [aut-ct](https://github.com/AdamISZ/aut-ct) as the primary mechanism for sybil resistance, however fidelity bonds can also be used with aut-ct.
