Conversely, if you lose one of the signer keys (and the software wallet that goes with it), having any of the other keys lets you recover this information. E.g. your house burns down along with one signing device, your Bitcoin Core node and its wallet, but you still have a signing device in a vault. \n\nCalling this s had me confused.
