Your reply is from 2nd May, today 20th May Kore is at 8,5% of the network (and from what I read after this whole thing many ppl have ordered start9 and decided to run a node with knots, so the numbers should increase). While still irrelevant \u201cin the big picture\u201d I think this is undeniably a signal of loss of trust in core, when this % of ppl suddenly switch away from core it means something that deserves attention is going on. And instead of ignoring it, it can be taken as an oppurtinity to understand if maybe something has been done wrong and how to avoid it happening again in the future</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"vostrnad\" data-post=\"3\" data-topic=\"1650\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/user_avatar/delvingbitcoin.org/vostrnad/48/422_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> vostrnad:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conflict of interest doesn\u2019t really matter here.

Please don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m not suggesting to shift the primary focus from technical to broader, what I am suggesting is that non-technical things cannot be simply not ackowledged and put aside because they are non-technical and so irrelevant (I am afraid this approach will have the consequence of creating more distrust and unneccesary debates from the general node operators)</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"vostrnad\" data-post=\"3\" data-topic=\"1650\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/user_avatar/delvingbitcoin.org/vostrnad/48/422_2.png\" class=\"avatar\"> vostrnad:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, they cannot.

As you have seen, the most vocal opposition is comprised of \u201cbtc monetary maxis\u201d, they look at btc as freedom money and they are here for the revolution and they are very passionate (and I include myself here). I believe most have reacted the way they did because btc primarily as freedom money has been \u201cnot protected and seems to be not a given anymore\u201d. After what happened I think you core have realized that are 2 things that really heated things up 1) taking away nodes capacity to set limit (perceived as taking freedom away); and 2) defining btc as database for whatever without underlining that the monetary purpose is still the priority and most fundamental aspect of btc.</p>\n<aside class=\"quote no-group\" data-username=\"gmaxwell\" data-post=\"5\" data-topic=\"1650\">\n<div class=\"title\">\n<div class=\"quote-controls\"></div>\n<img alt=\"\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" src=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/letter_avatar_proxy/v4/letter/g/fbc32d/48.png\" class=\"avatar\"> gmaxwell:</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please ask about them then!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</aside>\n<p>Do you guys have an avenue to gather users concerns? or you read and participate in the public discussions when an issue arises?</p>\n<p>Other final thoughts:</p>\n<p>You devs are amazing and the \u201cunkind\u201d statements that some users have directed at you are not  cool at all, but please look at them as an emotional reaction due to excessive passion for bitcoin as freedom money.\nYou guys should focus on the code because that is what you are amazing at, you should not have to spend so much time gathering users concerns and reading through posts to formulate a reply (this is all time taken away from working on code).
