  "raw": "Expanding on privacy implications...\n\nNaturally, any time information is shared, there is a privacy implication. A `path_query` reveals a downstream node - either a hop or the destination - to the prospective routing node. When iterated upon, each node in the path becomes aware of the *queried* destination. Meanwhile, a `path_reply` implicitly reveals information about channel balances. As so, let's consider sender/receiver anonymity and channel balance privacy:\n\n*Sender Anonymity*\n\nWhile a single query does not tell a routing node about the source of a payment, the number of queries a routing node receives and whom they come from may reduce the anonymity set of the *query origin*. Depending on the nature of the payment, the sender may consider anonymity in it's path construction process, including adding trampoline hops or opting out of queries altogether.\n\n*Receiver Anonymity*\n\nWhile the receiver does not have a choice in how a payment gets routed to them, they do get to choose the entry point of the payment via blinded routes. Using path queries, a receiver can construct more reliable paths to itself; the longer the path, the more anonymity from the sender and it's gang of routing nodes. The receiver may also choose to construct their sub-path using trampolines to prevent routing nodes from discovering full paths.\n\n*Privacy of channel balances*\n\nFirst, it's important to note  the following:\n\n1. In source-based routing, payment reliability and channel balance privacy are fundamentally at odds with one another. If a path is constructed with zero knowledge of channel balances, payment success probabilities are low, and vice-versa, perfect knowledge leads to optimal routing. \n2. Channel balance is shared between channel peers, which means nodes already have a trust relationship with their peers regarding privacy.\n3. Channel balance information can already be obtained by other nodes via probing. \n\nWith that in mind, path queries differ from trial-and-error (including probing) in the manner that liquidity uncertainty is reduced. Trial-and-error informs the *sender* about liquidity on the path, while path queries informs the *requester* about liquidity on the path. In our PEER_ONLY strategy described above, the sender (S) gained no information about liquidity on the network other than what was used for the final path.
