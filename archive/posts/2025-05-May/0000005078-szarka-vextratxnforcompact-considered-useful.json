On a node that applies restrictive spam-filtering policies, a substantial number of filtered transactions can be recovered from `vExtraTxnForCompact`, saving the need to request them from peers during compact block reconstruction.\n\n## Motivation\n\nAn underappreciated feature of [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) is [`vExtraTxnForCompact`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9499), which is a sort of purgatory where a hodgepodge of misfit transactions swirl around a ring buffer before being shuffled off into the void. Here, transactions replaced in the mempool, orphans, and transactions rejected for policy reasons await a last chance at redemption during compact block reconstruction. If they get mined, the node uses them to reconstruct the block instead of requesting them from its peers.\n\nPoor little vExtra doesn't get much respect, having been implemented opportunistically in a way that isn't especially robust. And, by default, only 100 transactions are buffered. Consequently, it seems, a lot of folks engaged in the recent brouhaha around `OP_RETURN` forgot about (or were never aware of) its very existence. If nodes filter moby datacarriers (and other spam), the thinking went, they won't have those transactions around to reconstruct blocks and will have to request them from their peers. But, in fact, those transactions may be present in vExtra.\n\nEven for nodes running with Core's defaults (i.e., `datacarriersize=83`) and a modest increase of `blockreconstructionextratxn` from its default of `100` to `1000`, as [0xB10C reported last year](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stats-on-compact-block-reconstructions/1052/1), vExtra improves compact block reconstruction performance. But vExtra's potential is even greater for nodes that apply more restrictive policies. For nodes running Bitcoin Core, that might mean `datacarriersize=0` (for now, at least) and `permitbaremultisig=0`. For nodes running [Bitcoin Knots](https://github.com/bitcoinknots/bitcoin), which uses the same code to handle vExtra but allows more control over policy, there's potentially a much larger number of rejected transactions added to vExtra.\n\n[Sjors recently proposed](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/32510) a (temporary?) change that would only put replaced transactions, not transactions rejected by policy, in vExtra.
