This is impossible to do directly in Bitcoin script without something like covenants.</p>\n<p>In the paper, we also use it to sketch a trustless bridge design to a \u201clayer two network\u201d, with the purpose of scaling Bitcoin with a rollup-like design and enabling more functionality and privacy.</p>\n<p>This protocol potentially allows STARK verification to be executed on top of it, which might not be viable to do on top of BitVM due to the long proofs used by STARKs.</p>\n<p><strong>Stateful computation</strong></p>\n<p>Stateful computation, as loosely defined above, can be split into two components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Logic persistence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Data persistence</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Logic persistence is about having Bitcoin locking scripts executed in a certain order or logical flow onchain. For example, suppose that tx1 implements locking script f1, and similarly, tx2 implements f2, and tx3 implements f3. Then, for \u201clogic persistence\u201d we want to make sure the order of execution onchain is</p>\n<p>f1 \u2192 f2 \u2192 f3</p>\n<p>Data persistence is about having some way to pass information between transactions (in the most simple case, think of some global memory storage). With logic persistence alone you can only guarantee transaction execution in some order, but there is nothing connecting the individual witnesses of the locking scripts involved. Data persistence gives you this capability.</p>\n<p>In the most simplistic case, consider the situation where we would like f1,f2,f3 to be executed on the same witness x. This means that if tx3 was spent, it is necessarily the case that</p>\n<p>f1(x)=f2(x)=f3(x)=1 (i.e. a single witness x was accepted by all 3 locking scripts)</p>\n<p><strong>Why stateful computation might be desirable</strong></p>\n<p>Two important instances are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Long computation that doesn\u2019t fit into Bitcoin\u2019s 4MB script size limitation or the 1000 stack element limitation</li>\n<li>A computation that is invoked across multiple points in time</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We are particularly interested in building smart contracts and bridges to L2 networks on top of Bitcoin with this.</p>\n<p><strong>Common solutions</strong></p>\n<p>For perspective, I list here some common solutions for stateful computation on Bitcoin:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Multisig (t-out-of-n): This is the simplest (non-)solution. We trust a committee of n entities, such that as long as t of them sign the UTXO, it evolves to the next state. It achieves stateful computation trivially but is basically a centralized solution (unless n is very large).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>More concretely, there is a tradeoff here between safety and liveness. If t is large, the multisig is more secure but has a liveness risk, and, conversely, for small t, the protocol is likely to be live but has a greater safety risk.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>(Strong) covenants: As long as covenants are strong enough to achieve both logic and data persistence, we could get stateful computation without additional security assumptions. You can do it with OP_CAT as I discuss here\n<a href=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/the-path-to-general-computation-on-bitcoin-with-op-cat/1106\">https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/the-path-to-general-computation-on-bitcoin-with-op-cat/1106\n</a>Possibly this is also doable with other proposed opcodes or a combination of them (as in <a href=\"https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Covenants_support\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Covenants support - Bitcoin Wiki</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We believe this is the desirable approach for stateful computation on Bitcoin, but it requires a soft fork and cannot be readily deployed.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>BitVM: This approach sits somewhere in the middle in terms of trust assumptions, being a 1-out-of-n system. In other words, as long as one entity is honest, the protocol is guaranteed both safety and liveness. This is a desirable property because it allows an operator who trusts only themselves to make sure the funds are always safe and operable.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>By analogy, covenants can be seen as a \u201c0-out-of-n\u201d solution here.</p>\n<p><strong>Our security model</strong></p>\n<p>We follow basically the same model as BitVM2, with two groups of entities</p>\n<ul>\n<li>n signers</li>\n<li>m operators</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Safety is guaranteed if 1-out-of-n signers is honest, and liveness is guaranteed if 1-out-of-m operators is honest. These are the only assumptions we require, while BitVM2 also requires onlookers who will defraud faulty execution by the operator.</p>\n<p>Hence, in a BitVM2-based L2 bridge, an operator needs to pay the user out of pocket when serving a withdrawal. Then, after the fraud proof time window closes, the operator gets reimbursed. In ColliderVM, since no fraud proofs are involved, the operator can get reimbursed immediately. This lifts the burden on the operator of staking high amounts of collateral.</p>\n<p>We consider this feature a main selling point of our construction.</p>\n<p><strong>How BitVM achieves stateful computation</strong></p>\n<p>Logic persistence is achieved through presigning transactions by the n signers. This way, as long as at least one signer refuses to sign transactions that don\u2019t follow the template, we can force a certain flow of transactions (as the txid of a previous transaction is encoded in one of the inputs of the next transaction)</p>\n<p>To achieve data persistence the clever trick by Robin Linus is to use one-time signatures. Consider the simpler Lamport version:</p>\n<p>Two seeds s0 and s1 are drawn and hashed as H(s0) and H(s1). We identify the \u201cmemory location\u201d of a bit with H(s0) and H(s1). To set the value of the bit [H(s0),H(s1)] to b=0,1, we reveal the seed sb. If both s0 and s1 are known, it means the operator was malicious and needs to be slashed. Hence, this approach inherently requires fraud proofs to work.</p>\n<p><strong>How ColliderVM achieves stateful computation</strong></p>\n<p>For logic persistence we similarly use presigned transaction templates.</p>\n<p>For data persistence, we replace the fraud proof-based one-time signature component with a hash collision-based one, somewhat reminiscent of ColliderScript (<a href=\"https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1802\" class=\"inline-onebox\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">ColliderScript: Covenants in Bitcoin via 160-bit hash collisions</a>), hence the name.</p>\n<p>The basic idea is as follows: Suppose that instead of a single flow f1 \u2192 f2 \u2192 f3, we have, for some set D, |D| copies of such a flow. Each flow encodes a single element d in D, that is</p>\n<p>(f1,d) \u2192 (f2,d) \u2192 (f3,d)</p>\n<p>Then, if we had a lot of flows |D|, or the size of the witness x was small, we could just check that x=d in the execution of a particular flow.

Long computation that doesn\u2019t fit into Bitcoin\u2019s 4MB script size limitation or the 1000 stack element limitation\n2. A computation that is invoked across multiple points in time\n\nWe are particularly interested in building smart contracts and bridges to L2 networks on top of Bitcoin with this.\n\n**Common solutions**\n\nFor perspective, I list here some common solutions for stateful computation on Bitcoin:\n\n1.
