For instance in Switzerland there are 10 Gbit/s fiber to the home plans for $100 usd / month, which could serve 2,500 Terabytes per month of data at a rate of 1 GB / second. Which works out $0.04 / TB transmitted. Bitcoin\u2019s chain is currently just under 600GB of data, or \u00a22.4 in server transmission costs to do an IBD. It would cost $480 total to provide data to all of the 20,000 currently existent nodes for their IBD. The 17GB / month to keep a node in sync with 4MB blocks @ 20k nodes would total 332 TB, at a cost of $13. $13 to feed to the entire trillion dollar-plus network with data for a month.
