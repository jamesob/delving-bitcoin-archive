A network of nodes is built, deterministically at random, given a number of reachable and unreachable nodes. Once nodes are connected to each other, a transaction is created from a random node and broadcast to its peers. This triggers a series of events that will spread the transaction across the network until every single node is reached (assuming the network is not partitioned).\n\nNodes in the network are well-behaved, meaning they stick to the `inv->getdata->tx` flow, do not announce transactions to peers more than once (nor to a peer that has announced it to them), do not send out a transaction more than once, do always reply to `GETDATA` messages is requested, but won't request multiple `GETDATA` for the same transactions, etc.\n\nThe transaction relaying logic follows Bitcoin Core's design (w.r.t privacy/DoS protection):\n\n* `INVs` are sent to peers on random intervals based on whether a peer is inbound or outbound:\n  * For inbounds, the delay follows a Poisson process with an expected value of `INBOUND_INVENTORY_BROADCAST_INTERVAL(5s)`. All inbounds are on the same timer\n  * For outbounds, the delay follows a Poisson process with an expected value of `OUTBOUND_INVENTORY_BROADCAST_INTERVAL(2s)`.
