Despite surface differences, they ultimately fall into two categories: proposals that standardize on a specific post-quantum construction via new address or output types, and proposals that introduce new opcodes dedicated to post-quantum signature verification.</p>\n<p>The first category consists of proposals that define a new address or output type explicitly designed for post-quantum security. A representative example is BIP360, which proposes a new output format that commits to quantum-resistant public keys or commitments, along with new validation rules for spending those outputs. In this model, the network gains first-class awareness of a post-quantum signature scheme at the UTXO level. The advantage is clarity and efficiency: witness formats can be optimized, verification costs are predictable, and wallets have a clear, standardized target to implement. The trade-off is that this approach necessarily standardizes on a particular family of post-quantum algorithms in consensus. Once such an address type is deployed, Bitcoin effectively commits to that cryptographic choice, and replacing it would require another consensus change. Over multi-decade timelines, this makes Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic assumptions harder to evolve.</p>\n<p>The second category involves introducing new opcodes that natively verify post-quantum signatures. Rather than defining a new address format, this approach extends Bitcoin Script with opcodes that validate signatures produced by a specific post-quantum algorithm. Technically, this can be more expressive than address-based approaches, since Script remains the primary vehicle for spending logic. However, the underlying trade-off is similar. An opcode that verifies a particular lattice-based, code-based, or hash-based signature embeds deep assumptions about performance, security margins, and algorithmic longevity directly into consensus. If cryptographic confidence shifts \u2014 as history suggests it will \u2014 Bitcoin would again face the challenge of deprecating or replacing consensus-critical logic.</p>\n<p>OP_CAT does not fit into either category. It does not define a new address type, nor does it introduce a dedicated post-quantum verification opcode. Instead, it restores a general-purpose scripting primitive \u2014 concatenation \u2014 that allows more complex verification logic to be expressed using existing opcodes. With OP_CAT available, hash-based signature schemes such as Lamport or Winternitz constructions can be implemented directly in Script by composing existing hash functions, conditional checks, and stack operations.</p>\n<p>The technical consequence of this approach is that Bitcoin avoids standardizing on any particular post-quantum algorithm at the consensus layer. Scripts can evolve independently of consensus rules, and different constructions can coexist without requiring new opcodes or address formats. The cost is efficiency: script-level constructions are larger and more expensive to verify than native signature opcodes. But those costs are borne only by users who opt in, rather than imposed globally.</p>\n<p>Seen this way, the distinction is not between \u201chaving\u201d or \u201cnot having\u201d post-quantum security, but between prescription and optionality. Address- and opcode-based proposals prescribe a specific cryptographic future at the consensus layer. OP_CAT expands the design space while keeping Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic commitments minimal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6653-op_cat-as-a-different-kind-of-tool-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6653-op_cat-as-a-different-kind-of-tool-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>OP_CAT as a Different Kind of Tool</strong></h2>\n<p>OP_CAT takes a fundamentally different approach from both address-based and opcode-based post-quantum proposals. Rather than standardizing a specific cryptographic construction in consensus, it restores a general-purpose scripting primitive that allows users to express more complex verification logic themselves. This shifts Bitcoin\u2019s posture from prescription to optionality: consensus remains small and stable, while the design space above it expands.</p>\n<p><strong>Minimalism and the Shape of Consensus Changes.</strong> From a consensus perspective, OP_CAT is deliberately minimal. It reintroduces a previously existing opcode with simple, well-defined semantics \u2014 concatenation \u2014 rather than adding new cryptographic verification rules. No new signature algorithm is embedded in consensus, no new address regime is created, and no assumptions are made about which post-quantum construction is \u201ccorrect.\u201d Crucially, OP_CAT also avoids locking Bitcoin into a premature decision. As time passes, developers and users can experiment with different post-quantum constructions at the script level, observe which designs are practical, secure, and usable in the real world, and learn from those outcomes. That experience can then inform any eventual, more opinionated upgrade if one is ever needed. No other proposal offers this feedback loop: address-based and opcode-based approaches commit Bitcoin to a specific cryptographic choice before the ecosystem has had the chance to learn from lived usage.</p>\n<p><strong>Cryptographic Neutrality and Sovereignty.</strong> There is also a critical but often overlooked cryptographic neutrality and sovereignty dimension to this debate. Both a dedicated quantum-signature opcode and a new quantum-safe address type implicitly require Bitcoin to standardize on specific post-quantum algorithms, which in practice means adopting U.S. NIST-approved standards such as SPHINCS+, Dilithium, or Falcon. That choice is not globally neutral. China has been explicit about pursuing digital and quantum sovereignty, developing its own cryptographic standards that are incompatible with NIST, and Europe is increasingly moving in the same direction. Hard-coding any particular post-quantum algorithm into Bitcoin consensus would therefore force Bitcoin to pick sides in a geopolitical standards war \u2014 fundamentally at odds with Bitcoin\u2019s role as a global, permissionless system. This concern is not hypothetical: in the classical cryptography era, the NIST-designed curve secp256r1 (P-256) has long attracted suspicion due to its unexplained constants and the historical involvement of the NSA, even though no public backdoor has ever been demonstrated. Satoshi was clearly aware of this risk and deliberately chose secp256k1, a curve not designed by NIST and free of unexplained constants.</p>\n<p>OP_CAT continues that tradition. It avoids mandating any algorithm or standards body, and instead restores a general-purpose scripting primitive (concatenation) that allows users to construct quantum-resistant schemes, using only cryptographic assumptions Bitcoin already relies on.</p>\n<p><strong>Practical Reusable Hash-based One-time Signatures.</strong> Hash-based one-time signature schemes such as <a href=\"https://scryptplatform.medium.com/quantum-resistant-bitcoin-using-lamport-signatures-77a2c5030448\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Lamport</a> and <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Zx_NMqZH65Y/m/LV5zE15qAQAJ\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Winternitz</a> have already been implemented in Bitcoin Script using OP_CAT. Because Lamport and related schemes are inherently one-time-use, practical reuse requires committing to many one-time public keys at once, typically by placing them into a Merkle tree and committing only to the Merkle root on-chain. Spending then requires revealing both the one-time signature and the Merkle authentication path. Verifying this structure in Script necessarily involves concatenating hash elements to recompute intermediate nodes and the Merkle root, making OP_CAT essential rather than optional. In this sense, OP_CAT is not merely an optimization, but a foundational building block for making hash-based, post-quantum signatures usable in Bitcoin.</p>\n<p><strong>Trade-Offs and Honest Limits.</strong> OP_CAT does not make post-quantum security free. Script-level constructions are less efficient than native signature opcodes. Hash-based signatures are larger, witness data grows, and verification costs increase. These are real costs that must be accounted for in policy limits and standardness rules. But they are also localized costs. Only users who opt into post-quantum scripts pay them, and they can evolve those constructions over time without further consensus changes. In this sense, OP_CAT trades some efficiency for long-term adaptability, preserving Bitcoin\u2019s ability to respond to cryptographic change without repeatedly reopening the consensus surface.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6653-conclusion-preparedness-without-panic-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6653-conclusion-preparedness-without-panic-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Conclusion: Preparedness Without Panic</strong></h2>\n<p>Bitcoin does not need to \u201cgo post-quantum\u201d tomorrow.

In this model, the network gains first-class awareness of a post-quantum signature scheme at the UTXO level. The advantage is clarity and efficiency: witness formats can be optimized, verification costs are predictable, and wallets have a clear, standardized target to implement. The trade-off is that this approach necessarily standardizes on a particular family of post-quantum algorithms in consensus. Once such an address type is deployed, Bitcoin effectively commits to that cryptographic choice, and replacing it would require another consensus change. Over multi-decade timelines, this makes Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic assumptions harder to evolve.\n\nThe second category involves introducing new opcodes that natively verify post-quantum signatures. Rather than defining a new address format, this approach extends Bitcoin Script with opcodes that validate signatures produced by a specific post-quantum algorithm. Technically, this can be more expressive than address-based approaches, since Script remains the primary vehicle for spending logic. However, the underlying trade-off is similar. An opcode that verifies a particular lattice-based, code-based, or hash-based signature embeds deep assumptions about performance, security margins, and algorithmic longevity directly into consensus. If cryptographic confidence shifts \u2014 as history suggests it will \u2014 Bitcoin would again face the challenge of deprecating or replacing consensus-critical logic.\n\nOP_CAT does not fit into either category. It does not define a new address type, nor does it introduce a dedicated post-quantum verification opcode. Instead, it restores a general-purpose scripting primitive \u2014 concatenation \u2014 that allows more complex verification logic to be expressed using existing opcodes. With OP_CAT available, hash-based signature schemes such as Lamport or Winternitz constructions can be implemented directly in Script by composing existing hash functions, conditional checks, and stack operations.\n\nThe technical consequence of this approach is that Bitcoin avoids standardizing on any particular post-quantum algorithm at the consensus layer. Scripts can evolve independently of consensus rules, and different constructions can coexist without requiring new opcodes or address formats. The cost is efficiency: script-level constructions are larger and more expensive to verify than native signature opcodes. But those costs are borne only by users who opt in, rather than imposed globally.\n\nSeen this way, the distinction is not between \u201chaving\u201d or \u201cnot having\u201d post-quantum security, but between prescription and optionality. Address- and opcode-based proposals prescribe a specific cryptographic future at the consensus layer. OP_CAT expands the design space while keeping Bitcoin\u2019s cryptographic commitments minimal.\n\n## **OP_CAT as a Different Kind of Tool**\n\nOP_CAT takes a fundamentally different approach from both address-based and opcode-based post-quantum proposals. Rather than standardizing a specific cryptographic construction in consensus, it restores a general-purpose scripting primitive that allows users to express more complex verification logic themselves. This shifts Bitcoin\u2019s posture from prescription to optionality: consensus remains small and stable, while the design space above it expands.\n\n**Minimalism and the Shape of Consensus Changes.** From a consensus perspective, OP_CAT is deliberately minimal. It reintroduces a previously existing opcode with simple, well-defined semantics \u2014 concatenation \u2014 rather than adding new cryptographic verification rules. No new signature algorithm is embedded in consensus, no new address regime is created, and no assumptions are made about which post-quantum construction is \u201ccorrect.\u201d Crucially, OP_CAT also avoids locking Bitcoin into a premature decision. As time passes, developers and users can experiment with different post-quantum constructions at the script level, observe which designs are practical, secure, and usable in the real world, and learn from those outcomes. That experience can then inform any eventual, more opinionated upgrade if one is ever needed. No other proposal offers this feedback loop: address-based and opcode-based approaches commit Bitcoin to a specific cryptographic choice before the ecosystem has had the chance to learn from lived usage.\n\n**Cryptographic Neutrality and Sovereignty.** There is also a critical but often overlooked cryptographic neutrality and sovereignty dimension to this debate. Both a dedicated quantum-signature opcode and a new quantum-safe address type implicitly require Bitcoin to standardize on specific post-quantum algorithms, which in practice means adopting U.S. NIST-approved standards such as SPHINCS+, Dilithium, or Falcon. That choice is not globally neutral. China has been explicit about pursuing digital and quantum sovereignty, developing its own cryptographic standards that are incompatible with NIST, and Europe is increasingly moving in the same direction. Hard-coding any particular post-quantum algorithm into Bitcoin consensus would therefore force Bitcoin to pick sides in a geopolitical standards war \u2014 fundamentally at odds with Bitcoin\u2019s role as a global, permissionless system. This concern is not hypothetical: in the classical cryptography era, the NIST-designed curve secp256r1 (P-256) has long attracted suspicion due to its unexplained constants and the historical involvement of the NSA, even though no public backdoor has ever been demonstrated. Satoshi was clearly aware of this risk and deliberately chose secp256k1, a curve not designed by NIST and free of unexplained constants.\n\nOP_CAT continues that tradition. It avoids mandating any algorithm or standards body, and instead restores a general-purpose scripting primitive (concatenation) that allows users to construct quantum-resistant schemes, using only cryptographic assumptions Bitcoin already relies on.\n\n**Practical Reusable Hash-based One-time Signatures.** Hash-based one-time signature schemes such as [Lamport](https://scryptplatform.medium.com/quantum-resistant-bitcoin-using-lamport-signatures-77a2c5030448) and [Winternitz](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev/c/Zx_NMqZH65Y/m/LV5zE15qAQAJ) have already been implemented in Bitcoin Script using OP_CAT. Because Lamport and related schemes are inherently one-time-use, practical reuse requires committing to many one-time public keys at once, typically by placing them into a Merkle tree and committing only to the Merkle root on-chain. Spending then requires revealing both the one-time signature and the Merkle authentication path. Verifying this structure in Script necessarily involves concatenating hash elements to recompute intermediate nodes and the Merkle root, making OP_CAT essential rather than optional. In this sense, OP_CAT is not merely an optimization, but a foundational building block for making hash-based, post-quantum signatures usable in Bitcoin.\n\n**Trade-Offs and Honest Limits.** OP_CAT does not make post-quantum security free. Script-level constructions are less efficient than native signature opcodes. Hash-based signatures are larger, witness data grows, and verification costs increase. These are real costs that must be accounted for in policy limits and standardness rules. But they are also localized costs. Only users who opt into post-quantum scripts pay them, and they can evolve those constructions over time without further consensus changes. In this sense, OP_CAT trades some efficiency for long-term adaptability, preserving Bitcoin\u2019s ability to respond to cryptographic change without repeatedly reopening the consensus surface.\n\n## **Conclusion: Preparedness Without Panic**\n\nBitcoin does not need to \u201cgo post-quantum\u201d tomorrow. It does need to avoid painting itself into a corner.\n\nOP_CAT represents a pragmatic middle path. It does not attempt to predict the future of cryptography. It does not impose new address regimes or bless particular algorithms. It quietly restores a small piece of expressive power that allows Bitcoin to adapt when adaptation is actually needed.\n\nQuantum readiness should look like this: boring, incremental, and reversible. OP_CAT fits that mold. It prepares Bitcoin not by declaring an end state, but by keeping the design space open \u2014 just enough to respond when the time comes.\n\n\\[1\\] Once a public key is revealed on-chain, a quantum adversary could either mount a **long-range attack** by later deriving private keys from historically exposed public keys and spending any still-unspent outputs, or a **short-range attack** by racing a transaction at spend time while it is in the mempool.",
