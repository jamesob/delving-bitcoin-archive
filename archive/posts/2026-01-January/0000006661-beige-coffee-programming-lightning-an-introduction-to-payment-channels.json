By the end of the course, students\u2019 implementations will pass some of the major BOLT 3 test vectors, meaning they will have successfully implemented functionality such as key derivation, obscured commitment numbers, and HTLC second-stage transactions (success and timeout).\n\nWhile most exercises can be completed by forking the GitHub repo and running the tests locally, the course is optimized to be completed on Replit. This is because each Repl comes with Bitcoin Core running in the background, allowing students to easily generate Lightning transactions as they complete the exercises and simulate operations such as broadcasting transactions, opening channels, sending payments, and decoding raw transactions.\n\nReplit: https://replit.com/@austin-f/Programming-Lightning-Intro-to-Payment-Channels?v=1\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/Beige-Coffee/programming-lightning-payment-channels\n\n## Goals\n\nProgramming Lightning has two main goals:\n\n1. Provide hands-on, in-depth protocol-level learning to help developers understand how Lightning works - preparing them to contribute to Lightning implementations, protocol design, or application development.\n\n2. Provide an accessible yet highly-technical resource for anyone wanting to deeply understand Lightning.\n\n## Up Next\n\nWith my Spiral & HRF grant continuing through 2026, I plan to build new chapters focusing on Lightning payments (authentication, onion routing, gossip), invoices (BOLT 11, BOLT 12), and newer protocol advancements like taproot channels, splicing, and more.\n\nFeedback and corrections are welcome!
