<a href=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stealth-addresses-using-nostr/1816\">\u201cStealth addresses using nostr\u201d</a> which had a Nostr-only approach.</p>\n<p>The design allows for notifications being sent outside of Nostr so for a clearer structure there is a Silent Payments and a Nostr part.\nThe Silent Payments outlines why the schema is suggested as it is and the Nostr part discusses the using nostr as the communication layer for the notifications.</p>\n<p><em>Note: this was posted as Gist before the comments received there are summarised below as an \u201cappendix\u201d</em></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6626-silent-payments-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6626-silent-payments-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Silent Payments</h2>\n<p>Silent Payments offer a novel way for receiving payments without interactivity.\nBut the way SP is designed it requires us to look for the needle(s) in the haystack(s).</p>\n<p>The sender (Alice) knows which needles she placed in the haystacks.\nThe receiver (Bob) needs to check everything to know what belongs to him!</p>\n<p>The BIP already proposed out-of-band communication to somewhat alleviate this burden for the receiver.\nIf the sender lets the receiver know that she made a payment to Bob in tx1 then Bob does not necessarily have to check tx2,3,\u2026,n in a given block.\nIf Bob thinks Carol or an unknown person sent him a payment without a notification he can always fall back to full scanning.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6626-so-how-can-we-structure-such-a-notification-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6626-so-how-can-we-structure-such-a-notification-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>So how can we structure such a notification?</h3>\n<p>The minimum requirement for notifications to make sense is the txid.\nThen Bob can theoretically find all the relevant information to prove to himself that the notification is legitimate.</p>\n<p>But ideally Alice sends more information.\nIn order to fully compute the outputs \u201cfrom scratch\u201d, Bob needs the previous scriptpubkeys.\nThose are not within the block data and in most cases are not trivial to retrieve.\nSo Alice should also provide the tweak for the tx.\nThis adds no burden to Alice as she had to compute tweak anyways to compute the output for Bob.</p>\n<p>A confirmed blockhash/-height would be very useful for Bob to find the txid faster.\nThis should only be optional though.\nProviding Bob with the confirming block is going to add a new burden on Alice.\nAlice then has to monitor the transaction and can only send the notification once she knows the confirming block.</p>\n<p><em>Note: One could also add the relevant outputs to this as well.\nI\u2019m not certain where I stand on this.\nThe notification and the transaction should be verified.\nIn that process the outputs would be most likely touched anyways.\nIf Merkle proofs were used the confirming height/hash would be required.</em></p>\n<h3><a

that the blockhash is optional and can be omitted by Alice.\nIn that case Bob needs to check what the status of the transaction is.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6626-receiving-the-notification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6626-receiving-the-notification-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Receiving the notification</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This write-up tries to be as unopinionated as possible regarding wallet implementations.\nIdeally any source from full-node to light client + indexer should work with the design outlined.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One way how this could look:\nUpon receiving the notification Bob checks for the txid against his chain backend.\nBob pulls the transaction and does the receiver-scan computations for the transaction.\nHe already has the tweak so he needs no further external information.\nHe computes the ECDH secret and finds out which outputs in the transaction belong to him.\nThen Bob\u2019s wallet can proceed as it would with any other found output.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-6626-nostr-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6626-nostr-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Nostr</h2>\n<p>Using Nostr as a means of communication for the notification messages would be an option.\nWhich Nostr messaging logic and which keys are used is quite important.\nThe wrong approach could leak metadata and degrade privacy of Bob and possibly Alice.\nMany of the intricacies have been discussed in the post and comments of <a href=\"https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/stealth-addresses-using-nostr/1816\">\u201cStealth addresses using nostr\u201d</a> on Delving Bitcoin.\nI have outlined the worst case below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A bad design would be using NIP-04 direct messages. Using Alice\u2019s npub and Bob\u2019s scan key. NIP-04 leaks which npubs have had direct communication. The whole world would know that Alice has had interaction with Bob\u2019s scan key.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>NIP-17 would conceal the sender but still show which npub has received some form of information.\nThese notes could be anything from privately stored information to a message or notification.\nAs there the sender is not linked these notes can be anything.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-6626-which-key-does-the-receiver-use-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-6626-which-key-does-the-receiver-use-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Which key does the receiver use?</h3>\n<p>Now that Alice\u2019s key does not matter anymore we will look at the keys for Bob.\nSeveral Options exist:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use the scan key</li>\n<li>Use a dedicated new key for the address</li>\n<li>Bob\u2019s existing npub that he uses for normal nostr activity, or any key with additional non-SP activity</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(1) Using the scan key would be simple as it does not require additional handling of an npub for outside activity which is not related to the SP address.\nAn immediate downside is that any Nostr activity for that npub would be a strong \u201cpayment received\u201d signal for outside observers.</p>\n<p>(2) A key which was created with the sole purpose of using it for receiving notification messages would have the same issues as (1).</p>\n<p>(3) The additional activity would help conceal the strong \u201cpayment received\u201d signal.\nThe only issue would be if Bob wants to separate his Nostr identity and his SP address.\nBut in that case it\u2019s probably better to fall back to full scanning for now.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that one could design wallets in a way that Alice could copy-paste the above JSON to send via any messenger.

Therefore relying on standard Nostr practices with rate limiting relays etc. should suffice.\n\nSome ideas though:\n* merkle proofs could limit the damage but the asymmetry is on the side of the attacker here\n* Nip-13 PoW on notes.\n  Asymmetry is more in favour of receiver but too much of this and we then should rather rely on Bitcoin\u2019s PoW.\n\n=> The spec described here is more on the optimistic side of things.\nIf things are fine we get to scan very cheaply.\nIf they go bad everything is just as without notifications.\n\n### Bad implementations sending incorrect tweaks\n\nThe following scenario is of concern:\n\n1. Alice sends Bob a notification and includes the tweak.\n2. The tweak is valid for an output in the transaction.\n3. The tweak was **not** derived according to the Silent Payments spec\n\nNow Bob has two options:\n\n1. Immediately Spend the UTXO / move to a protocol compliant address\n2. Make sure to store the tweak and map it to the coin.\n\nThe coin has become unrecoverable without the tweak information from the notification message.",
