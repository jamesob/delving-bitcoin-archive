Moving away from this for single sig wallets will not be trivial. This post is mainly intended at multisig or more advanced wallets, but if we can fix single sig key reuse too, that\u2019d be a win.</p>\n<p>I would like to define yet another \u201cstandard\u201d that would reasonably guarantee that a user will not reuse keys, even on different software wallets, when they reuse a signing device.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-4896-desired-properties-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-4896-desired-properties-5\"></a>Desired properties:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Works across vendors</strong>. Different software following the \u201cstandard\u201d will always generate wallets with different xpubs, avoiding key reuse</li>\n<li><strong>Does not depend on others implementing it</strong>. A software <strong>NOT</strong> following the \u201cstandard\u201d will not use the same xpub as a wallet created with a software following the spec (unless malicious)</li>\n<li><strong>Should work with current wallet flows</strong>. Some multisig software wallets already offer \u201cone click\u201d wallet rotation, without requiring access to the signing device. Others might generate multiple xpubs per seconds. Both of these use-cases should be covered, and more if we find them</li>\n<li><strong>Should be fool proof</strong>, the point is to improve UX without breaking privacy</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-4896-some-proposed-ideas-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#p-4896-some-proposed-ideas-6\"></a>Some proposed ideas</h3>\n<p>Hardened path, requires the signing device to generate the wallet</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Random path</strong>. As \u201cstandard\u201d derivation paths are irrelevant to output descriptors, we can simply randomize the paths. [FINGERPRINT/xx\u2019/Random\u2019].\nThis is the simplest of all solutions and would work pretty great for all cases. For very large signers (belonging to many thousands of wallets, typically cosigners), another derivation layer could be added. [FINGERPRINT/xx\u2019/Random\u2019/Random2\u2019]</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic path</strong>. For example using UNIX time at the time the xpub is requested to the device. [FINGERPRINT/xx\u2019/1745925\u2019/432\u2019]. In this example I used the UNIX time. I arbitrarily split it at the 1 000sec digit. It would fit in a single level but will hit the 32-bits limit in 80 years.\nAnother approach would be to use a human readable date, for example [FINGERPRINT/xx\u2019/20250429\u2019/124630\u2019], where the first level is the date, the second is the time in Hours Minutes Seconds. This is quite easy from a UX perspective</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Storing state at each xpub request to the signing device</strong>. As the same seed can be imported to multiple hardware devices, this state has to be synchronized, therefore be shared with a server (public or not). The \u201caccount\u201d can then be increased by 1 for each request. [FINGERPRINT/48\u2019/0\u2019/x\u2019/2\u2019] or whatever format, where x is increased. This method would need to be multi-vendor compatible</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Out of these options, my preferred is 2, followed by 1.</p>\n<p>1- Random path:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some malware used random derivations in the past, creating stigma</li>\n<li>It works all the time, even if you generate 1000s of xpubs per seconds (co-signers?)</li>\n<li>Doesn\u2019t rely on any state</li>\n<li>Hardware don\u2019t like \u201cnon-standard paths\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2- Deterministic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can be made user-friendly, understanding why the path looks like it does (date/time)</li>\n<li>Works for humans, but might not work for a machine as-is.

I believe with precision level at the second it should be OK, but it is simple to increase this to a millisec if believed useful.\nOne UX issue I am aware of is that some hardware wallets will display a warning for \u201cnon-standard\u201d derivation paths.
