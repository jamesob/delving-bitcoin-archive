For context, I've been thinking about how to solve [the bidding problem](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/post-signature-cross-input-scripting-using-the-taproot-annex/1520/3?u=josh), which refers to the problem of efficiently authorizing many possible bids on different UTXOs, without knowing which will be accepted. At its simplest, this requires a delegated commitment to many possible txids. I imagine that this type of mass delegated introspection would be useful for many other use cases (like coinjoins, vaults, and channel factories), and I was curious if CSFS could enable this functionality.\n\nWe concluded that it can, but it would require a fairly bespoke script and an opcode which can verify a merkle proof, like PAIRCOMMIT. The idea is to:\n1. Use CSFS to sign a merkle root\n2. Use multiple PAIRCOMMITs to verify a leaf on a merkle tree of a fixed height\n3. Use CSFS and CHECKSIG on a dummy private key to verify that the leaf equals the desired sighash.\n\nHere is how the script might look (full credit to @reardencode for this implementation):\n\n```\n                  | <txsig> <sig> <path...> <leafhash>\nDUP               | <txsig> <sig> <path...> <leafhash> <leafhash>\nTOALTSTACK        | <txsig> <sig> <path...> <leafhash>\nPAIRCOMMIT...     | <txsig> <sig> <root>\n<key>             | <txsig> <sig> <root> <key>\nCHECKSIGFROMSTACK | <txsig> <0|1>\nVERIFY            | <txsig>\n<G>               | <txsig> <G>\n2DUP              | <txsig> <G> <txsig> <G>\nFROMALTSTACK      | <txsig> <G> <txsig> <G> <leafhash>\nCHECKSIGFROMSTACK | <txsig> <G> <0|1>\nVERIFY            | <txsig> <G>\nCHECKSIG          | <0|1>\n```\n\nIt's a fairly complex script, but it works. We can extend this approach to multi-signature inputs, by duplicating the merkle root and verifying the threshold number of signatures.\n\nIt's worth noting that the leaf hash does not need to be a sighash. It can be any type of data, as long as there is an introspection opcode able to verify it.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThe primary limitation of CSFS+PAIRCOMMIT is that the height of the merkle tree must be pre-committed to. This could be somewhat inefficient, if the merkle proof has to be unnecessarily large. Users could mitigate this by committing to multiple tapleafs with a varying number of PAIRCOMMITs, but this has its own costs.\n\nA secondary limitation is that this approach can't be used with key path spends or in wallets that haven't pre-committed to the necessary tapscript(s). Users would need a special wallet and a larger, more complex descriptor, which isn't ideal. Alternatively, users might make a preparation transaction every time they want to use this functionality.\n\n## Alternatives\n\nI attempted to solve this problem in [this post](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/post-signature-cross-input-scripting-using-the-taproot-annex/1520/3) by giving consensus meaning to the annex.

This approach would be compatible with a soft fork and would allow for on-the-fly delegation across one or more signatures without needing pre-committed tapscripts with fixed merkle heights.
