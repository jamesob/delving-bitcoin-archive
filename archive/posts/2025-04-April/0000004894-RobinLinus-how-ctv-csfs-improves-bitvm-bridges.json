Say we want to express \u201cinputA is spendable only together with inputB\u201d.\n\n1. Define inputB to be a (legacy) P2SH output.\n2. Presign a signature using sighash `ANYONECANPAY|NONE`, effectively signing only inputB. This signature commits to inputB and since P2SH is not SegWit the signature will be in inputB\u2019s scriptSig.\n3. Define inputA to be a P2TR output and contain a CTV condition with a template hash that commits to the scriptSigs, including the signature for inputB.\n\nThe result: **inputA** commits to the signature for **inputB**, which itself commits to **inputB**. So **inputA** becomes spendable only in conjunction with **inputB**.\n[/quote]\n\n\nFor completeness, we are encountering another issue with this construction:\n\n* If `inputA` and `inputB` are created by the same transaction, we cannot apply our trick, as it would create a hash cycle.\n* For the same reason, we cannot apply it to any `inputB'` that is a child of `inputB`.\n* Similarly, we cannot apply it to any `inputA'` that is a child of `inputA` and connected via a chain of CTV hashes.\n\nFurthermore, `inputB` should use sighash `ANYONECANPAY|ALL` to ensure it creates the correct output. However, it could still be spent \"maliciously\" without `inputA`.",
