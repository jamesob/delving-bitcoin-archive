I agree that this is a problem that needs to be solved.\n\nThe scheme you propose is simple and would appear to work, assuming SHA256 can be used as a secure KDF where the key is derived from a large subset of the data it is encrypting.

In a $k$-of-$n$ multisig descriptor, the secret $s$ is split into $n$ shares using shamir secret sharing, where $k$ shares are needed to recover. Each share is then encrypted with one xpub, so that $k$ xpubs are needed to decrypt.\n\nThe other minor difference is that I leave the derivation paths in plaintext, so that a user knows how to derive their xpubs.
