# Solutions for this new centralization INSIDE Bitcoin?

Since institutions got on board, defending Bitcoin is defending centralization in the same ones.

After my [rejected proposal](https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/paralel-bitcoin-only-for-conscious-living-individuals/1877/1), what keeps getting around in my mind is this new centralization in Bitcoin, which mimics the centralization in Fiat.

Are there any proposed solutions to avoid or remove institutional and oligarchic centralization in Bitcoin?
