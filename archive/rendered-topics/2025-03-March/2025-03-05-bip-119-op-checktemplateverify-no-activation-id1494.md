See comments on the mailing list (pending) for any combination of CTV + another primitive, as it proposed by Bitcoin Core PR #31989, afaict.

If we go to discuss the merits of BIP-119, we should discuss of its *technical* merits alone. By design, it was very restraint to avoid OP_EVAL style of issue, again.
