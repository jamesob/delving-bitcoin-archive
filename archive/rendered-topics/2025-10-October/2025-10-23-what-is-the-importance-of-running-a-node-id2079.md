# What is the importance of running a node?

jal | 2025-10-23 19:06:16 UTC | #1

People seem to be fighting for the idea that every single person in the world runs a node.  I don’t think many people will or will want to.  

A lot of people on the internet seem to be arguing about node policy.  I have never had a single one answer my question:  Why should you be running a node? 

I think any answers don’t really have any merit or bearing on one’s own security.  

What does one get in regard to security or any other benefit from running a node? 

If this thread lies empty…my point stands….

To know, that the coin you use, is really Bitcoin, and not something else.

For example, you can detect some mining pools, that can sometimes produce invalid blocks. If you would have just some SPV wallet, then you would happily accept a transaction, and later, it could turn out, that you didn’t get anything. Especially if some mining pool would tell you, that you got a lot of coins from some non-standard transaction. Then, by having only SPV wallet, you can be convinced to accept it, and when it will turn out, that it is invalid, it could be too late, if you for example send a real, physical product to some customer.

Because there is no need for 100% of the users to run a node. Or rather: there is no need for 100% of the network, to have full, archival nodes, storing every single transaction since 2009. For example, it could be even beneficial, if Initial Blockchain Download would no longer require processing every single transaction, because then, the burden of storing some transactions, would be shifted from nodes to users, and if nobody cares about some spammy transaction, then it could be discarded entirely (and coins could still stay spendable, but they would require providing a valid proof, that some coins are there; and only someone, who has some inputs or outputs involved, could keep that transaction, without bothering anyone else).

Of course. In the same way, you can say, that most people wouldn’t read Linux source code, or even most of the Open Source code, that is actively used. But the ability to do so, is what is worth keeping. And the same here: as long as there are enough nodes, that can keep the network alive, other users can live peacefully on the edge of that network. Remember: nodes should be able to leave and join at will: it is not about having full, archival node. It is about the ability to do so, if needed.

Because in general, if you have a fractional reserve system, you can be left with nothing, if other people will get their cash before you. But in case of Bitcoin, it can be different, because as long as you can store a proof, that you have a given amount, then you can always get it, and move it somewhere else. The purchasing value of it can change over time, but if you have 1 BTC, then you have 1 BTC, even if the price can drop or rise.
