# What is the importance of running a node?

People seem to be fighting for the idea that every single person in the world runs a node.  I don’t think many people will or will want to.  

A lot of people on the internet seem to be arguing about node policy.  I have never had a single one answer my question:  Why should you be running a node? 

I think any answers don’t really have any merit or bearing on one’s own security.  

What does one get in regard to security or any other benefit from running a node? 

If this thread lies empty…my point stands….
