**Problem:**

It has been years since I left college and did not complete my engineering degree, but I don’t want students to continue with incorrect assumptions.

* Some of the top universities in India have a [blockchain](http://collegecirculars.unipune.ac.in/sites/documents/Syllabus2023/Bsc.(Block%20chainTechnology)_19122023.pdf) subject in the final semester.
* The textbook contains many incorrect concepts.
* Question papers from the last few years are discouraging.

**Solution:**

* I can visit some of those colleges, but I don’t have enough resources or influence.
* Chaincode Labs and other organizations could collaborate with local institutions.

**Reason:**

* India has the largest population in the world.
* People are obsessed with AI but don’t understand how bitcoin works.
