# Lehar / Parlour Paper

There’s an academic  paper [“Market Power and the Bitcoin Protocol”](http://ewfs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tx_fees-18.pdf) that claims to have strong empirical evidence that miners are strategically leaving fees on the table as this drives up average fees over time. 

Is there criticism or agreement with this conclusion?  It certainly contradicts that general wisdom that miners are fee-maximizing with every single block.
