# Code of Conduct Violation: Banning Antoine Riard for 3 months

Hi all,

After ongoing harassment, under the CoC, we have decided to remove Antoine Riard (@ariard) from the GitHub lightning organization, and blocked contributions to the repository for 3 months.

I generally believe in a broad tent and tolerance, but if you produce more harm then benefit to a group you will be asked, then told, to leave.  Doing this clearly is a net win for everyone, including Antoine, who can now find something more useful to do.

The initial Lightning IRC channel had a simple base topic: "Be excellent to each other".  I've been proud to see you all uphold that!

Thank you,<br>
Rusty & Vincenzo.
