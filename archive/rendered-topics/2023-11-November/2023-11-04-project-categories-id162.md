# Project categories?

What do people think about adding categories for bitcoin-related projects?

I've been thinking about adding one for [bitcoin-inquisition](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/wiki) for announcements/discussions, and maybe it would be interesting for other projects that don't want to admin their own dedicated forum?

It's apparently possible to make a group for the project owners and give them permission to moderate posts in their category.

Maybe just add something like 'tools and libraries' category ?

Although with your example, bitcoin-inquisition, this might not work, as it is neither exactly a "tool" nor a "library". But maybe you could classify it as a "tool" for a "deep investigation of the value of proposed consensus changes"
