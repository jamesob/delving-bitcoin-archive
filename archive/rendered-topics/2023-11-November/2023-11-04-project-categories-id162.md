# Project categories?

What do people think about adding categories for bitcoin-related projects?

I've been thinking about adding one for [bitcoin-inquisition](https://github.com/bitcoin-inquisition/bitcoin/wiki) for announcements/discussions, and maybe it would be interesting for other projects that don't want to admin their own dedicated forum?

It's apparently possible to make a group for the project owners and give them permission to moderate posts in their category.

Maybe just add something like 'tools and libraries' category ?
