# Differential Fuzzing of Bitcoin implementations

Hi, all! 

I'm working on differential fuzzing of Bitcoin implementations/libraries (https://github.com/brunoerg/bitcoinfuzz). I'm starting it with miniscript, so at this moment it's fuzzing Core's and rust-miniscript. 

I'm openning this topic to raise ideas and get feedbacks about it.

Nice, and it seems you've discovered something too (https://github.com/sipa/miniscript/issues/140)!

Yes, I got more crashes but I'm analyzing them before publishing them.
