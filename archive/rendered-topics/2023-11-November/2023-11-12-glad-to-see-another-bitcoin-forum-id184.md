# Glad to see another bitcoin forum

Hi everyone.

I randomly surfed upon this site after seeing a link to it on https://stacker.news/items/306869

I like the forum software.  What kind of software runs it?  In other words, how could I set up my own forum like it?  I already have a webserver that I could use.  I just don't know what type of software I should look to install on it.

It's a discourse site, see https://discourse.org/ and https://github.com/discourse/discourse/blob/1e1bb45b969093731cb6c252af3c66147ecbb286/docs/INSTALL.md perhaps.
