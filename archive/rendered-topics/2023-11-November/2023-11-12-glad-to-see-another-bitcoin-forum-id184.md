Hi everyone.

I randomly surfed upon this site after seeing a link to it on https://stacker.news/items/306869

I like the forum software.  What kind of software runs it?  In other words, how could I set up my own forum like it?  I already have a webserver that I could use.  I just don't know what type of software I should look to install on it.
