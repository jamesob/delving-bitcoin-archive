# CPU usage of peers

This is a thread to discuss the CPU usage of peers.

## Interesting things:
* average case / expected CPU usage per peer
-> what are some broad strokes of where CPU time is spent? 
* worst case CPU usage for a single peer -> this can help us understand if increasing the total number of incoming slots is okay, or could be problematic
* worst & average case CPU usage for a block-relay-only peer vs full-relay peer -> for more granularity around evaluating the above 
* how different network conditions impact the expected CPU usage per peer
