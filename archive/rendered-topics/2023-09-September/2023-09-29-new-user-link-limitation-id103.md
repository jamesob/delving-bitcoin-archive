# New user link limitation

EthnTuttle | 2023-09-29 03:17:14 UTC | #1

I just drafted a post and went to submit the topic but encountered an error that I could only submit a post with two links as a new user. I understand this is to prevent spam, but:

Is there a way to submit a draft for review from moderators to approve? Or just in general get someone else's review before publishing?

Are mods able to remove the "new guy" moniker? If so, how might one solicit for the removal?
