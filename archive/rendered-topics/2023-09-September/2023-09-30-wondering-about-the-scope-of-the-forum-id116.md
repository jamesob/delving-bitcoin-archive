# Wondering about the scope of the forum

Hi there! Thank you for building this forum. I love the idea of a modern space to host high quality discussions around bitcoin that's longer form than Twitter and not as hard to follow as the mailing list. I read the forum every week, and I promote it in my circles.

I'm wondering if you could clarify the scope of what you'd like on the forum with regards to things like L2s and other bitcoin-related-but-not-directly-bitcoin protocols. For example I came today to post a high-level explanation of the blinding signature scheme used in the Cashu protocol (it's different than Fedimint), but realized I wasn't sure where this post might belong, or even if it was welcome on this forum in the first place.

A post clarifying the general scope for the forum would be great! No hard feelings if Cashu does not fit within that scope of course.
