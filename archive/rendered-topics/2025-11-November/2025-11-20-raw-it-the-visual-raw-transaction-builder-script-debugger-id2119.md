# Raw₿it — the visual raw transaction builder & script debugger

rawBit | 2025-11-20 11:41:25 UTC | #1

I’ve spent the last year building the tool I wanted when learning raw transactions:

a **visual, node-based editor** where you can drag-and-drop predefined nodes on canvas to build Bitcoin transactions from scratch.

**What you can do today in raw₿it**

\- Build raw Bitcoin transactions visually by connecting nodes on a canvas

\- See the **exact Python code** running behind every single calculation node

\- Step through **script execution** and watch the stack mutate at each opcode

\- Change amounts, locktimes, scripts and instantly see preimages, signatures, witnesses, TXID/WTXID update

\- Multi-tab workspace, full undo/redo, dark mode, local save/load and shareable flows, testnet/mainnet/regtest switch

\- Comes with **10 hands-on lessons** (P2PKH, multisig, timelocks, SegWit, payment channels, etc.) — all transactions broadcast to testnet for verification. **More lessons coming soon.**

**Privacy and Scope**

\- Completely **open-source** and **freely** available online.

\- Hosted version: calculations run on a minimal backend (rate-limited, no data stored). Local install: 100 % offline.

\- Designed primarily as an educational tool — not intended for managing real funds.
