# Presenting One Focus in One Acccedence Focus

I admit that I misunderstood lambda in Bitcoin, let's relearn what the capitalists have taken, let's reclaim the rights that should belong to us. Although I have many desires including forcing the market to agree to the Layer-1 that I conceptualized, the Layer-1 under 21 Million that I am not aware of is a need that is clearly different from wants, needs and wants.

In changing times, my stance must not change, the one thing I need for Bitcoin Core is to realize the following formula γ^(i/R) + ∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j) this means that every Exposed Blockchain or every Exposed Bit will go through Weighted Summing before the arrival of a new bit or Blockchain, to no longer be touched by natural errors, although I was annoyed by some of the treatment but I am aware that it starts from my way of delivery, which I initially believed in Decentralization but why did the treatment in Bitcointalk ban my other accounts? i admit it it's my mistake and great hope for us to realize γ^(i/R) + ∑(S[0:i]·τ·φ^j) especially in the Poisson Sum, every Poisson Sum that is Exposed will be through Weighted Summing is the key, hopefully it will be useful and better criticism than being considered to never exist, let's go to true freedom.
