Glad to inform the community that we have finished our work on the formal specification for the RGB consensus layer. The paper can be found here: https://github.com/RGB-WG/yellowpaper/blob/4c18a6ac346a4dd379766f0bf2fcc02a3ca7e722/rgb-yellowpaper.pdf

Dr. Orlovsky, your RGB yellow paper is quite comprehensive. So whatâ€™s the way forward for its implementation and mass adoption? I think you would need to develop a set of tools(or Toolboxes) for writing/editing, debugging and deploying  the RGB compatible smart contracts as well as interacting with them in a safe secure way. Besides I think most likely killer applications for RGB-smart contracts would be securing complex multiparty contracts between hardware and software product vendors, infrastructure operators(like DePINs), end-users and managing Digital Twins of software-intensive hardware assets and components e.g. mobile devices, wearable computers, automobile parts and avionics components deployed on high performance blockchains such as OpBNB, TON and more efficient editions of Liquid.  Please share your thoughts. I would love to collaborate with you.
