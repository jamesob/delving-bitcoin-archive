# Can Game Theory Secure Scaling?

Hi all,

I'm a bit frustrated with the trend of using custodial lightning wallets. It’s simply cheaper to use custodians these days... and I believe that it isn’t necessary. The crucial part of sovereignty is the ability to sign a message, which doesn’t incur any costs. Therefore, I believe there is a way to make self-custody both fast and cheap.

There have been a lot of new proposals in the last year, so I kind of doubt you're interested in thinking about another one... Still, I'd like to try to get some feedback on my proposal, which I'm calling "Last Mile."

The basic idea is to use classic bitcoin transactions without broadcasting them unless there's a dispute. Honest behavior is encouraged through calibrated incentives, in simple terms, making theft uneconomical.

And here is my current way of thinking:

*This approach is somewhat naive, but maybe there is some potential. Perhaps it will motivate you to help me improve it into something even better.*

I would love to read your feedback!
