# LRC-20: Scalable and Fast Tokenization on Lightning

akitamia | 2024-04-17 13:42:15 UTC | #1

Abstract. The LRC-20 standard embeds additional information into Bitcoin transactions by tweaking public keys in Bitcoin outputs, enabling a novel, compact, and efficient approach for tokenized assets to be issued and transferred on Bitcoin and Lightning. LRC-20 nodes communicate on a peer-to-peer layer in order to recognize and validate LRC-20 trans- actions. Due to the simplicity and standardization of the key-tweaking mechanism, LRC-20 tokens can be seamlessly ported onto the Lightning Network, delivering faster and cheaper LRC-20 transactions. LRC-20 transaction amounts can be blinded for additional privacy, and issuers can implement freezing capabilities if they choose to.
