<h1>CISA: Cross-Input Signature Aggregation</h1>

Signature aggregation allows aggregating a set of signatures into a single signature which reduces transaction weight and fees. 

Research and Development: https://github.com/BlockstreamResearch/cross-input-aggregation  
Playground: https://github.com/fjahr/cisa-playground

||savings|
|---|---|
|half aggregation|7.6%|
|full aggregation|9.6%|
|max |15.2%|


<h2>Observations</h2>

Consider an example in which Alice has 3 UTXOs (A1, A2 and A3) in her wallet that could be used separately to pay Bob, Carol and Dave in different transactions. Normally, she would pay them separately and some of these transactions could have change although inputs remain different.

Without CISA:
```mermaid height=146,auto
    graph TD;
    A1-->B;
    A2-->C;
    A3-->D;
```
If Alice gets some discount on weight and fees by aggregating signatures, she would prefer to use all inputs in the same transaction and pay them. 

With CISA:
```mermaid height=146,auto
    flowchart
         A1,A2,A3 --> B,C,D
```

> Apart from incentivizing users to harm their privacy, it requires a **new address format** and new taproot key type. So these transactions would be easy to differentiate on chain and make chain analysis easier.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

CISA encourages practices that are bad for privacy and introduces lot of complexity for marginal fee savings.

I think you're ignoring the existing effect of [payment batching](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/payment-batching/).  Let's use and extend your examples, providing numbers.  All examples below assume P2TR keypath inputs and P2TR outputs with  sizes from [Optech's tx calc](https://bitcoinops.org/en/tools/calc-size/).

**No batching or CISA:**

```mermaid height=147,auto
    graph TD;
    A1-->B[B,A<sub>change</sub>];
    A2-->C[C,A<sub>change</sub>];
    A3-->D[D,A<sub>change</sub>];
```

Each tx has 1 input and 2 outputs (payment & change), making it 154 vbytes.  Three transactions is thus 462 vbytes.

**Batching without CISA:**

In the worst case, this is:

```mermaid height=147,auto
    flowchart
         A1,A2,A3 --> B[B,C,D,A<sub>change</sub>]
```

The size is 355 vbytes, a 23% savings over the base case.

In the best case, this is:

```mermaid height=147,auto
    flowchart
         A1 --> B[B,C,D,A<sub>change</sub>]
```

That best-case size is 240 vbytes, a 48% savings over the base case.

**With batching and CISA:**

The best-case from above remains exactly the same (assuming CISA doesn't add any overhead).  In the multi-input case:

- Half-agg reduces the size of the second and third inputs by 8 vbytes each, bringing the transaction size down from 355 vbytes to 339 vbytes.  This is an extra 3.6% savings.
- Full-agg reduces the size of the second and third inputs by 16 vbytes each, brining the transaction size down from 355 vbytes to 323.  This is an extra 7.1% savings.

The existing Bitcoin protocol heavily incentivizes batching.  CISA makes batching only slightly more efficient, so I don't think there's any reason to consider it a privacy problem on that basis.

I'm not aware of CISA necessarily requiring a new address format, and even if it does, I assume that it can be an address format that encompasses most expected output uses (like taproot), so it will eventually become the default address format.  I don't think we should avoid adding useful new features to Bitcoin because there will be a transitional period where it's easier to distinguish between upgraded and non-upgraded wallets.

Additionally, CISA reduces the cost of creating coinjoins and payjoins, two deployed protocols that improve privacy.  It may also reduce the cost of other protocols that enhance privacy, including both current protocols (like LN channels closes with multiple in-flight HTLCs) and proposed protocols.  The cost reduction is modest, but I think anything that gives privacy an advantage is worth considering.

From what I understand, CISA does require a new output script type as adding it to P2TR would imply a hardfork. The new output script type could definitely use the same address format (bech32m).

This will be below 5% if there is no change or more inputs are used.

Batching is mainly done to pay multiple people in the same transaction irrespective of inputs used. The problem here is mostly related to inputs and not outputs. Multiple inputs in the same transaction that belong to us affect privacy in 90% of the cases.

Examples: Unnecessary input, Mixed types of inputs, Toxic change as input etc.

CISA demotivates coin control and incentivizes more inputs to be used in the same transaction. Coinjoin is less than 10% of bitcoin transactions.

Are you saying that users will do more coinjoin because of 5% discount but they wont do normal transactions in which all inputs belong to them?

Technically, you could do a limited CISA that requires you to use a taproot script path, but only needs one signature for each of the revealed paths. Compared to a non-CISA key path spend, that'd reduce the savings from 64B per input to ~29B per input, which is probably not really worthwhile. (Hardforking CISA and applying it to old scriptPubKey formats in general is interesting as it would make it cheaper to clean up old p2pkh utxos, etc)

I think you're oversimplifying how consolidation works here; you have to look at long term steady state behaviour across time.

Suppose a person starts with $N$ utxos and never co-spends inputs. In this case, they will create a new change output $\simeq$ always, meaning each payment has no effect on $N$. Meanwhile, every time they receive a payment they increment $N$. So this is $N \rightarrow \infty$, a conclusion not affected by usage pattern. Even worse, you will tend to accumulate dust utxos at the end of long peeling chains - such chains being ideal for the adversary blockchain analyst because interpreting them is often the simplest, least ambiguous kind of tracing. The possibility of a perfect match between available utxo sizes and the payment size obviously limits this blow up to infinity, but doesn't change the general conclusion - this is not workable.

While crude, I think that model is crucial to bear in mind - consolidation is not optional.

In the other extreme, suppose a person's utxo selection policy is "max greed". Always spend *all* currently owned utxos. In this case the average value of $N$ over time will depend on the person's usage pattern. If they are a "merchant" usecase type, where they receive much more frequently than they spend, they will do a lot of consolidations, and often have a large value of $N$. If they are a consumer usage type, with very rare large deposits and lots of small spends, they will have $N=1$ almost always.

CISA would mean a small incentive pushing in the direction of the max greed algo for any given current situation with $N>1$. Call it 15% say. It isn't clear that that's *worse* than a policy that's closer to the first ("never co-spend") policy, albeit we've dismissed that first one in its exact form, as impossible. It'll just depend on the usage pattern.

"CISA means more co-spends" might not be valid if you take into account that more co-spending now might lead to less co-spending later (but it depends, blah blah), and this cannot be dismissed with "never co-spend" because that's not possible. And more co-spends over time isn't unambiguously worse, either.

(in all of this I'm deliberately ignoring the effects on global utxoset size, because users will never be motivated by that)

The cost reduction is modest, but I think anything that gives privacy an advantage is worth considering.

I think one should be careful to tease out what is incentivized here. In my opinion, privacy is *mostly* not incentivized by CISA, it kind of is true as a "second order" effect but not directly. Consider 3 parties wanting to spend 1 input from each of $A, B, C$ ; CISA incentivizes them to create their transaction together, but does not incentivize them to make any obfuscation effect in the pattern of their input and output values (consider that the solution of the subset sum problem is very trivial for randomly chosen 3 party batches). It *does* make it slightly cheaper to create a privacy-enhancing transaction pattern, but it equally incentivizes them to create any other pattern, and the latter *will require less effort*.

To give a very obvious contrast, consider Lightning (or really any functional L2): the cost savings and the privacy effect are intrinsically linked; they're both a direct effect of the non-presence on-chain and you can't have one without the other.

You could argue that, since CISA gives greater benefits the larger the group who are collaborating to form a single transaction, it incentivizes privacy in this way, but this delta in cost (as you approach the asymptotic best) is really very small; if it were not very small, then I would be more optimistic on this point - because, as vague as it is, the subset sum problem *is* more and more intractable with a $ \simeq O(n!)$ scaling. I agree that e.g. payjoin (or maybe things like batched channel opens) are incentivized somewhat by this.

> The size is 355 vbytes, a 23% savings over the base case.

Interesting point to consider. Though "sendtomany" functions exist in many wallets, we have no "join a payment batch with other users by pressing this button" outside of coinjoin, and the obvious reason is, it's "bloody hard" to do and inconvenient. Even without the hassle of forcing equal sized outputs, coordinating users to do transactions together is way too much hassle and not worth 23% (or whatever) savings in fees.

Maybe I could not express myself properly in this thread but I will try one more time with no cryptography involved:

CISA incentivizes more inputs in one transaction and they belong to same person in most transactions no matter what privacy benefits, layer 2 etc. exists for collaborative transactions.

This affects not just privacy but existing coin selection algorithms.

Didn't notice any significant increase in the coinjoin volume for joinmarket with 10x reduced fees (minrelaytxfee):
