Linked below, a high level paper on how covenants could be introduced to Bitcoin without a soft fork using a mix of Functional Encryption and Zero Knowledge Proofs, posted here for discussion.

Hi Jeremy,

thanks for this, looks very interesting. As I'm reading I'm seeing something that looks like a typo:

"Next, encrypt $m$ " - should that be $p$ ? and,

$UniqueSecKey(p, TX) = Add(m, CTVHash(TX))$

Same, shouldn't $m$ be $p$ here?
