Category for discussing BIP352 wallet support, ranging from protocol updates to implementation details.

More specifically, this is a category for discussing descriptors, PSBTs, signing devices (HWW), and light client protocols. Discussion my also include implementation techniques and optimizations. This group is not for discussing the merits of BIP352 itself, e.g. how it compares to other protocols, whether or not it should be implemented, etc. Discussions of the merits of BIP352 or proposals to change the BIP should happen on the bitcoin dev mailing list.
