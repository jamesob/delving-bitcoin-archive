# Where to post information about new protocol releases?

For instance, we work on a number of Layer 2 and 3 Bitcoin protocols, including RGB smart contracts, new rust Lightning implementation (LNP), bitcoin-bases self-sovereign identitites (SSI) etc. What is the best category to post announcements about the new releases of such libraries and tools?

There's an #announcement tag that's been used for software releases in the #implementation category. For protocol improvements, might be better to make a post with the sort of content you'd present at a conference, rather than just an announcement though? In general, post where you think is best, and it can be moved later if it turns out there's somewhere better (can be flagged "off-topic" to encourage such a move; vs "spam" if it's inappropriate for the site as a whole).

Second question: is it possible to request to add a mew tag “client-side-validation”? The topic is general enough and covers more and more tech: OpenTimeStamps, RGB, shielded client-side validation, TapAss - and more to come.

Once you participate more on the forum (reading posts, reacting to posts, writing posts/replies) you'll get automatically updated from "new user" to higher trust levels. People who've made it to level 2 aka "member" should be able to create new tags themselves, I believe.
