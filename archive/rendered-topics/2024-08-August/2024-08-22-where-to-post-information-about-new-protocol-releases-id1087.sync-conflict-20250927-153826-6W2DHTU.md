# Where to post information about new protocol releases?

For instance, we work on a number of Layer 2 and 3 Bitcoin protocols, including RGB smart contracts, new rust Lightning implementation (LNP), bitcoin-bases self-sovereign identitites (SSI) etc. What is the best category to post announcements about the new releases of such libraries and tools?

There's an #announcement tag that's been used for software releases in the #implementation category. For protocol improvements, might be better to make a post with the sort of content you'd present at a conference, rather than just an announcement though? In general, post where you think is best, and it can be moved later if it turns out there's somewhere better (can be flagged "off-topic" to encourage such a move; vs "spam" if it's inappropriate for the site as a whole).
