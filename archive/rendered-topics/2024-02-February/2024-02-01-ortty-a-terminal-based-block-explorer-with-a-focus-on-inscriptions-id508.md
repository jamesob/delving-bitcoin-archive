# Ortty: a terminal-based block explorer with a focus on inscriptions

I'm just announcing a little project I've been working on called ortty, which as the title says, is a Blockchain explorer for terminal junkies like myself, focused on allowing you to dig through the Ordinals Inscriptions stored in your node.

It has multiple pieces:

* An explorer that allows you to dig into the blockchain to look for inscriptions interactively. It can even show images if your terminal supports it!
* A scriptable CLI that can be used to view and also extract inscriptions en masse.

You can find ortty [here](https://github.com/ursuscamp/ortty) with binary released for major platforms.

Here are some screenshots of the explorer at work. These images were made with the terminal emulator kitty, which has the best image support, IMO:
