# Subscript rendering in graph broken in Safari

While reading @sipa's post on cluster mempool I noticed a glitch:

Consider the transaction graph below

Strangely in Safari on macOS 13.6.4 and 14.3.1 the subscripts numbers  are missing from the graph. They seem to get bunched in the top-left corner:

![subscripts|690x420](upload://cSNreuchXWJzi095wLRWD8khoYz.png)

They do render correctly in Chrome.

Bringing this up in a meta topic to not distract the conversation there.
