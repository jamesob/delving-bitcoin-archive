# What are interesting parts of the Bitcoin Core codebase?

I have a super smart friend who I'm trying to nerd-snipe into getting interested in working on Bitcoin Core. My super sneaky plan is to point him to some particularly juicy parts of the codebase to try to pique his interests.

Does anyone have any favorite parts of the Bitcoin Core codebase? They could be particularly elegant, do something particularly impressive, or be particularly interesting theoretically. I'll definitely also point him to libsecp256k1!
