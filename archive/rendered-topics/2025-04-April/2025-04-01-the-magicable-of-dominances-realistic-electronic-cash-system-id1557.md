The first question is whether we can exchange Blockchain with Hydra? In Syllogistic Logic or called Mantiq by Imam Al Ghazali there is a correlation that realizes a case like this and we distinguish two of them, the old block remains in the realm of Blockchain while the new transaction we can move the role to Hydra System.

Then what about Quantum Computing? Qubits can't go right and left in a single visionary but it only solves much faster than humans estimate making Cryptography so far, we forget the Theoretical and energy that will be drained early is the Qubit, so we have to make a Drained Qubit.

Blockchain is where one person or group in one address can send transactions to the next party without bank intermediaries and double spending, in Hydra when Alice sends 1 Million coins to Bob = The Hydra system running 14.47% Threshold of Maximum Nodes A.K.A 941 Nodes, 136,627 or 136 Nodes before Checksum with SAI-15 (Hydra so different than Hydra Sustainable Vault) and what the proof of math?. C=Σ F_I ^x³ / (x² + 15)
r/n when r it's rally on threshold < 14.47% and n it's nitrous on SAI-15.

When we can start? We have to create a Hydra System first and then the second is that we test the checksum verification with SAI-15. In Hydra Visualization we can see the transaction already flies and done, if rate on threshold < 14.47% Actived answer BTC transaction does not run temporarily until it reaches nitrous. So this is fair.

Analogy to Hydra and Proof of Fraction

If we relate this to Proof of Fraction in Hydra, then:

M-P | M-S | S-P → Could represent stages in nitrous on SAI-15.
M (Middle Term) → T+941 on going.

P (Predicate) → Validation outcome (Threshold and Math Criteria).

S (Subject) → Transaction in process.

Thus, transaction validation can be explained using syllogistic structure!

A-I-I, E-A-O, I-A-I.
Could represent different possible transaction results, depending on the fraction calculated in the PoF system / depending on the validation blocks calculated in the PoW system.

Example:

A-I-I: All transactions meet a certain proof of fraction / proof of work→ Some transactions are validated.

E-A-O: No transactions meet the proof of fraction / proof of work → All transactions are rejected.

I-A-I: Some transactions meet the proof of fraction / proof of work → Some transactions are accepted.

A-I-I: All Threshold Adjust the criteria 14.47% → Done to checksum validation

E-A-O: If you are still at the rally on threshold → Transaction could not be completed.

I-A-I: Sender complete the validation process before it gets to the Receiver → Your Hydra it's completed.

Final Result: Alice prepares a certain amount of funds to send to Bob → Hydra System Perform checksum validation → If r (transaction could not be completed) / If n (transaction has been done) → Complete.

If sending from the Proof of Fraction / Proof of Work Consensus Mechanism is not from the Investment or Wallet results, then after checksum validation → Acccedence approves 0,0002231668236 Successful Participants up to 1 with 50x Participants match / Double Poisson Sum Criteria (Acccedence it's like The dynamics of change from time to time with limited real time).

We need Quside Company's Entropy Core physical product for execution SAI-15 and need a Cipher Quantum Shield (QSC01) to create Heterodyning from 144kHz slow down to 22kHz as this makes the system of malicious nodes and malicious groups uncertain to Shutdown.

And this is my identity that is impossible to trace with SHA256 except for SAI-15 4fbbc8e089720d559de2e4ba351ef411ee602a86c7da1a05894d5d7bd831685f and this is for reference in Signature where Bitcoin no longer uses ECDSA but SLH DSA and for Reference we can learn Axiomatics from A MODEL OF THE AXIOM OF DETERMINACY IN
WHICH EVERY SET OF REALS IS UNIVERSALLY BAIRE
