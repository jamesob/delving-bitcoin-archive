Isn't the Spearhead of Bitcoin a Poisson Sum? Because Bitcoin has one miracle of Concrete Mathematical proof, I created the concept of the Hydra System, the new Cryptography and the Hydra Sustainable Vault which you can see here https://syamailcointheogwhitepaper.tiiny.site at least if you don't agree, you can implement half of the Syamailcoin concept like SAI-15 Cryptography, now let's focus on the Double Poisson Sum.

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

// Function to compute Poisson CDF: P(X <= k) for X ~ Poisson(lambda)
double poisson_cdf(int k, double lambda) {
    if (k < 0) return 0.0;
    double sum = 0.0;
    double term = 1.0; // Initial term for k = 0: lambda^0 / 0! = 1
    for (int i = 0; i <= k; ++i) {
        sum += term;
        term *= lambda / (i + 1); // Next term: (lambda^i / i!) * (lambda / (i+1))
    }
    return sum * std::exp(-lambda); // Multiply by e^(-lambda) at the end
}

int main() {
    // Given parameters
    double hashrate = 0.0039‡; // 0.39% as a fraction
    int num = 1400;           // Number of 10-minute intervals
    double z = 1.96;          // z-score
    double p = 0.04999579029644097; // Target probability (unused directly here)

    // Compute lambda for one miner
    double lambda = hashrate * num; // 5.46
    double lambda_total = 2 * lambda; // 10.92 for two miners

    // Normal approximation threshold
    double sigma = std::sqrt(lambda_total); // Standard deviation ≈ 3.305
    double k = lambda_total + z * sigma; // Threshold ≈ 14.47
    int m = static_cast<int>(std::ceil(k)); // Next integer: 18

    // Compute P(X >= m) = 1 - P(X <= m-1)
    double prob = 1.0 - poisson_cdf(m - 1, lambda_total);

    // Output results
    std::cout << "Lambda per miner: " << lambda << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Total lambda (two miners): " << lambda_total << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Standard deviation: " << sigma << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Threshold k: " << k << std::endl;
    std::cout << "m (ceiling of k): " << m << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Probability P(X >= " << m << "): " << prob << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

Expressist Philosophia, Bitcoin is Functionality on Money and from Mathematics explanations.

Maybe I don't think I'll ever be able to create a new coin alone like Syamailcoin max Supply 9,470,000 or The market refuses and with me who doesn't have a team but it makes me always admit and want to learn. I never compare Bitcoin vs Syamailcoin because Underlying Syamailcoin is an Entropy Pool and not Tracakble digital gold.

Why Bitcoin Decentralization in reality is Functionality on Money and from Mathematics explanations not Presenting One Focus of Acccedence in Cryptography even Supernova itself?.
