# Hornet Update: A declarative executable specification of consensus rules

In September 2025, I published a paper on my work towards a pure, formal specification of Bitcoin's consensus rules.

> Hornet Node and the Hornet DSL: A minimal, executable specification of Bitcoin consensus. T Sharp, September 2025. https://hornetnode.org/paper.html

I have now completed the C++ executable declarative specification for non-script block validation rules: 34 semantic invariants in total.

## Background

Hornet is a minimal, executable specification of Bitcoin's consensus rules, expressed both in declarative C++ and in a purpose-built domain-specific functional language. 

It is implemented as a suite of modular, dependency-free, modern C++ libraries and includes a lightweight node capable of Initial Block Download (IBD).

Hornet's concurrent, lock-free UTXO(1) engine achieves an 11× validation speedup over Bitcoin Core on full-chain replay (discussed in Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #391). All consensus logic is encapsulated by the declarative specification described below.

## Update 2026-04-15

The question of whether a block is valid or invalid can -- and should -- be expressed as a Boolean, pure function without state changes or side effects.

Hornet aims to specify this logic declaratively and semantically, both in C++ and in a functional domain-specific language.

I have now completed the set of non-script block validation rules, organized with one semantic invariant per rule, with a total of 34 rules composed via a simple algebra. The first 15 rules are shown below.

```cpp
// BLOCK VALIDITY SPECIFICATION
static constexpr auto kConsensusRules = All{
  With{MakeHeaderContext, All{                // ## Header Rules
    Rule{ValidatePreviousHash},               // A header MUST reference the hash of a valid parent block.
    Rule{ValidateProofOfWork},                // A header's hash MUST achieve its own proof-of-work target.
    Rule{ValidateDifficultyAdjustment},       // A header's proof-of-work target MUST satisfy the difficulty adjustment formula for the timechain.
    Rule{ValidateMedianTimePast},             // A header timestamp MUST be strictly greater than the median of its 11 ancestors' timestamps.
    Rule{ValidateTimestampCurrent},           // A header timestamp MUST be less than or equal to network-adjusted time plus 2 hours.
    Rule{ValidateVersion}                     // A header's version number MUST NOT have been retired by any activated soft fork.
  }},
  With{MakeEnvironmentContext, All{ All{      // ## Local Rules
    Rule{ValidateNonEmpty},                   // A block MUST contain at least one transaction.
    Rule{ValidateMerkleRoot},                 // A block’s Merkle root field MUST equal the unique Merkle root of its transactions.
    Rule{ValidateOriginalSizeLimit},          // A block’s serialized size excluding witness flags and data MUST NOT exceed 1,000,000 bytes.
    Rule{ValidateCoinbase},                   // A block's first transaction MUST be its only coinbase transaction.
    Rule{ValidateSignatureOps},               // The total legacy signature-operation count over all input and output scripts MUST NOT exceed 20,000.
    Each{TransactionsInBlock{}, All{
      Rule{ValidateInputCount},               // A transaction MUST contain at least one input.
      Rule{ValidateOutputCount},              // A transaction MUST contain at least one output.
      Rule{ValidateTransactionSize},          // A transaction's serialized size excluding witness flags and data MUST NOT exceed 1,000,000 bytes.
      Rule{ValidateOutputsNonNegative},       // All transaction output amounts MUST be non-negative.
      ...
```

The declarative specification separates *what must be true* from *how it is computed*. Each `Rule` line names a C++ function that validates the specific semantic rule in question, and also gives an English description of the rule being enforced.

The above statically-typed declarative graph is the executable specification of the semantic invariants that precisely determine consensus validity of a block in the Bitcoin network. Each Rule node names a validation function that returns a unique error code if and only if that property fails to hold.

We can parse the same code to automatically generate an English table of the semantic rules:

| ID | Rule | 
|-|-|
||**Header Rules**
H01|A header MUST reference the hash of a valid parent block.
H02|A header's hash MUST achieve its own proof-of-work target.
H03|A header's proof-of-work target MUST satisfy the difficulty adjustment formula for the timechain.
H04|A header timestamp MUST be strictly greater than the median of its 11 ancestors' timestamps.
H05|A header timestamp MUST be less than or equal to network-adjusted time plus 2 hours.
H06|A header's version number MUST NOT have been retired by any activated soft fork.
||**Local Rules**
L01|A block MUST contain at least one transaction.
L02|A block’s Merkle root field MUST equal the unique Merkle root of its transactions.
L03|A block’s serialized size excluding witness flags and data MUST NOT exceed 1,000,000 bytes.
L04|A block's first transaction MUST be its only coinbase transaction.
L05|The total legacy signature-operation count over all input and output scripts MUST NOT exceed 20,000.
L06|A transaction MUST contain at least one input.
L07|A transaction MUST contain at least one output.
L08|A transaction's serialized size excluding witness flags and data MUST NOT exceed 1,000,000 bytes.
L09|All transaction output amounts MUST be non-negative.
...

## Future work

The spending rule S06: "A non-coinbase input MUST satisfy the spent output's locking script" is correct, but on its own clearly doesn't capture the internal complexity of script execution. I am working towards a separate layer of specification for script rules.

The declarative C++ specification is a step towards a pure, functional domain-specific language for a Bitcoin consensus spec. This will be implemented in a future iteration, together with an interpreter and/or compiler. Here is an example of the Hornet DSL:

```
// The total number of signature operations in a block MUST NOT exceed the consensus maximum.
Rule SigOpLimit(block ∈ Block)
    Let SigOpCost : (op ∈ OpCode) -> int32 
    |-> ⎧  1  if op ∈ {Op_CheckSig,      Op_CheckSigVerify     },
        ⎨ 20  if op ∈ {Op_CheckMultiSig, Op_CheckMultiSigVerify},
        ⎩  0  otherwise
    Require Σ SigOpCost(inst.opcode)
            ∀ inst ∈ script.instructions
            ∀ script ∈ tx.inputs.scriptSig ⧺ tx.outputs.scriptPubKey
            ∀ tx ∈ block.transactions
        ≤ 20,000
```

## Conclusion

I welcome feedback from the developer community. In particular, do you believe there is value in a formal specification of consensus rules? Are there any aspects of Hornet that you like or dislike? Are there any rules that you believe are missing, redundant, unclear, or incorrect? I also welcome any bug reports. Thank you.

Hi Toby. There is immense value in this. Your approach to treating consensus validity as a pure, side-effect-free boolean function perfectly mirrors our own architectural philosophy at the covenant and transaction derivation layer.

While Hornet formalizes node-level block consensus, our recent work on the PRECOP framework formalizes transaction topology and covenant execution. We rely on Simplicity to enforce deterministic, fail-closed state transitions, shifting from "passive verification" to mathematical necessity.

Regarding your future work on rule S06 (Script rules): this is precisely the frontier. We are currently upstreaming native Bitcoin introspection jets into `rust-simplicity` to ensure that script evaluation and economic invariants can be formally verified without relying on external witnesses.

The convergence of a declarative node consensus (Hornet) and a deterministic covenant execution environment (PRECOP/Simplicity) is exactly how we harden Bitcoin's base layer. Excellent initiative, we will be watching your progress closely.
