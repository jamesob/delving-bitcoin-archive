## What is Drivechain?

Drivechain allows you to create different types of sidechains in which withdrawals are approved by miners. Users have the freedom to experiment with different features by sending bitcoin from main chain to sidechain and withdraw from it later.

Since changing consensus rules on bitcoin will become difficult with time, sidechains seems to be the best way possible to scale, improve privacy, user experience etc.

## Is Drivechain possible without BIP 300 and 301?

Yes, it is possible. A [proof of concept](https://sha-gate-demo.netlify.app/) that uses OP_CAT and some introspection opcodes to achieve this: https://github.com/mr-zwets/upgraded-SHA-gate

Bytecode generated by the compiler has these opcodes:

In this script some introspection opcodes are used:

```
OP_INPUTINDEX
OP_OUTPUTVALUE
OP_UTXOVALUE
OP_OUTPUTBYTECODE
OP_UTXOBYTECODE

OP_OUTPOINTTXHASH
```

These can be emulated with `OP_CAT`, `OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK` and a few other basic opcdoes.

## Drivechain using BIP 300 and 301

[BIP 300](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/bc520fade5cc838d5c6e9b72d2fc12b691c80125/bip-0300.mediawiki) implmentation introduces an opcode `OP_DRIVECHAIN` and six new blockchain messages:

* M1. Propose New Sidechain
* M2. ACK Proposal
* M3. Propose Bundle
* M4. ACK Bundle
* M5. Deposit -- a transfer of BTC from-main-to-side
* M6. Withdrawal -- a transfer of BTC from-side-to-main

Sidechains are first proposed (with M1), and later acked (with M2) for creation. This process resembles Bip9 soft fork activation.

[BIP 301](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/bc520fade5cc838d5c6e9b72d2fc12b691c80125/bip-0301.mediawiki) describes blind merged mining and introduces 2 messages:

1. BMM Accept -- How h* enters a main:coinbase. When Mary "accepts" a BMM Request, Mary is *endorsing a side:block*.
2. BMM Request -- Simon offering money to Mary, if (and only if) she will Endorse a specific h*. When Simon broadcasts a BMM Request, Simon is *attempting a side:block*.

h* : sidechain's merkle root hash 

Blind Merged Mining (BMM) allows miners to mine a sidechain, without running its node software (ie, without "looking" at it, hence "blind"). Instead, a separate sidechain user runs their node and constructs the block, paying himself the transaction fees. He then uses an equivalent amount of money to "buy" the right to find this block, from the conventional layer1 Sha256d miners.

## Criticism

Some developers have written about their opinions on Drivechain. Its not possible to cover all of them. I will focus on the [blog post](https://petertodd.org/2023/drivechains) written by Peter Todd in 2023 and Paul Sztorc's [response](https://www.drivechain.info/peer-review/peter-todd-2023.png) to it.

I agree with Paul's response and want to add a few points about mining centralization issues shared in the blog post:

- Stratum v2 does not decentralize anything. It could be considered an improvement over v1 but mining pools can still reject block templates.
- Mining is inherently centralized in bitcoin for different reasons and will remain the same until more pools in different countries, more hardware manufacturers and braidpool gains some traction.
- If covenant proposals are activated instead of BIP 300/301, we would end up with MEV issues that affect mining decentralization more than sidechains.

## Sidechain templates

There are some [sidechains](https://www.drivechain.info/projects/index.html) availalble for testing and you can try them using [launcher](https://www.drivechain.info/releases/index.html). I tried zcash sidechain and like the privacy, UX etc. 

![melt-cast|690x474](upload://1wI34laTUL2UNpe596mY2rFEMbB.jpeg)

I got some coins for the main chain using the [faucet](https://drivechain.live). Did fake coinjoin spending equal amount inputs to my own addresses. Used one of the UTXO to deposit funds from main chain to sidechain. This could be followed by other users as well to avoid privacy issues with the deposit transaction however it can also be deposited directly. My goal was to try [melt-cast](https://www.truthcoin.info/blog/zside-meltcast/) feature and compare it with payment pools that could be enabled with covenants.

## Conclusion

Drivechain will be possible on bitcoin with or without BIP 300/301 in a few years. We need to do more research and avoid trusting other opinions to decide if they should be activated with BIP 300/301 for evaluating their scaling, privacy etc. benefits.

Paul has mentioned that he is working on a system to enable drivechains without a soft fork in Core. Can you describe that protocol at all?

-------------------------

Paul has described the process in this podcast: https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/stewart-mackenzie-indaba/episodes/The-Stewart-Mackenzie-Indaba-39-Paul-Sztorc-e2dtf88

It uses 2 tools:

1. [Monitor](https://github.com/LayerTwo-Labs/bip300_monitor) scans blocks and see if any block breaks BIP 300 rules
2. [Enforcer](https://github.com/LayerTwo-Labs/enforcer) uses `invalidateblock` RPC to reject blocks

It can be considered an external way to do user activated soft fork without preparing a UASF client by forking bitcoin core.

Programmatically rejecting blocks via `invalidateblock` *is* a soft fork...

It's only a soft fork if there is economic consensus of the nodes to run it. In that case, it seems quite pointless: a UASF would be equivalent and cleaner.

If the goal is to get miners to adopt it without nodes consensus, it's just marketing for a 51% attack.

Paul named it CUSF (which is a pretty horrible name), but basically means SF without merging to core repo. You can run a vanilla core node and still enforce a soft fork by running an out-process validator.
