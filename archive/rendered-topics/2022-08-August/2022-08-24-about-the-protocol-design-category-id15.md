Bitcoin-related protocol proposals, or analysis or discussion thereof. For example, new P2P messages, new wallet techniques, methods for coinjoins or payment channels, etc.

Try to keep things accessible to developers -- so don't use formal academic terminology that you'd write in a paper, when your could write things more simply.

If you want to use maths, you can use LaTeX (mathjax) markup by surrounding inline formulas with `$`, for example: `$ 1+1=2 $` gives $ 1+1=2 $, or surrounding a standalone block with `$$`:

$$
1+1=2
$$
