# Deflationary money is a Good Thing

Redoing/expanding on a [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/ajtowns/status/1555784595873751040):

If you want a passive investment, there's really two options: one is you can just keep cash in a mattress; the other is you can buy some real assets and ignore them.

There are lots of ways you can buy real assets: you could buy some land that you just sit on, or gold that you leave in a vault, or shares in a company where you don't participate in running it, or give a bank your money and let them loan it out and hope they'll be able to pay it all back to you with interest at some point, but never actually be involved in vetting the borrowers or helping them make a profit to be able to pay your investment back.

There are likewise many of ways you can be an active investor in similar schemes: you can buy some land and build/remodel it, or you can buy a house and rent it out taking care to ensure your tenants are both careful and happy, or you can be a significant shareholder with a seat on the board or an executive role helping to make the business more profitable, or be an angel investor or offer microloans and actively help borrowers.

Another method of passive investing is to buy an asset, and then pay someone else to do all the active work -- a rental agent, or an ETF provider or CEO, or an investment firm.

My argument is all those passive investments are bad for society, and it would be better if those assets were owned by active investors instead.

Taking the last example first: hiring an agent to do all the work for you creates the principal/agent problem: the agent is incentivised to do the least work necessary to keep earning their commission, whereas what the principal would like is for the value of the asset to be maintained or increased as much as possible. Whether that be a real estate agent that doesn't really care about getting basic repairs done promptly, or a CEO who's more interested in getting big bonuses versus building the company for the long term.

Apart from the agency problem, passive investments will otherwise end up with underutilised real assets: property that's underdeveloped or underutilised, art that's kept locked away as an investment rather than displayed, commodities that are sitting in a vault rather than being used in production or as consumer goods, etc.

And what happens if passive investors suddenly exit the market for all those goods? Demand decreases, and so do prices: making it cheaper to buy a home instead of renting, cheaper to own a controlling interest in a company rather than a small percentage of shares, cheaper to retain ownership and control of a company you built rather than selling it off or more affordable to get promoted from an employee to a partner in a business, cheaper to buy consumables and capital for your business, and thus cheaper to produce consumer goods. All good things!

So why don't passive investors exit the market for all those goods? Because their alternative is sitting on cash, which is designed to lose value slowly over time even in the normal case, and regularly loses value in large jumps due to government mismanagement.

The only way that doesn't happen is if the value of holding cash over time is more than the value of holding real assets over time: if you can buy an empty plot of land today for $100,000, do nothing, and in ten years expect to sell it for $200,000 (about 7% pa), you'd be a fool to sit on your money; but if in ten years it would only sell for $90,000 (about -1% pa), sitting on your money doesn't look so bad.

Of course, in either case, if you were actively investing, then spending $100,000 to buy the land, and $50,000 to develop it, might then net you $20,000 pa in profit from renting it out, which leaves you with a net profit of $50,000 after ten years, even ignoring whatever the residual value of the asset ends up being. So active investment is still worthwhile even in a deflationary environment.

Likewise it doesn't mean every good will be immediately consumed by business: if businesses expect they can sell 1000 units of some commodity today for $100, or could sell 50 units today for $80 and the remaining 50 units in a decade for $70 then it still makes sense to preserve the goods rather than selling them immediately.

So might a deflationary currency -- like Bitcoin with its fixed supply -- not be such a scary idea after all?

There are, still, two meaningful potential downsides to a regime other than "controlled low inflation in the 2%-3% range".

The first is that governments can't trivially fund projects by printing money. However this is largely incompatible with "controlled low inflation" anyway -- either only covering a small fraction of government projects (perhaps 20% of federal government spending in Australia, eg), or funding insurance programs where inflation will be out of control if the event being insured against eventuates (eg insuring deposits in the banking system), or creating a hyperinflationary cycle. So for the cases where the scheme is compatible with the goal of controlled low inflation, funding seems likely to be relatively easily replaced by some other model (taxes or borrowing).

The second is that a deflationary currency might not be very predictable. People's preference between saving for the future versus enjoying in the present isn't constant, even averaged across an entire country. If "consumer confidence" goes down, people may prefer to save rather than spend, driving the relative value of the things they consider "saving" up, and the value of the things they consider "consumables" down. With an inflationary fiat currency, central banks can recognise this behaviour, and tweak the money supply and interest rates, so that wages and the average cost of consumables continues to rise slowly, and almost all of the volatility in prices is confined to things like real estate, and the stock market. With a fixed, deflationary currency that is heavily used for saving, however, the pricing volatility will naturally hit both consumer goods and the labor market: forcing businesses to mark down their goods, and then either fire or cut the salaries of their employees. After all, firing necessary employees because they won't accept a necessary cut in wages will damage the business; but being willing to accept a wage cut just because the employer claims it's necessary will result in never earning what you're worth. So (contrary to [what I wrote in the tweet thread](https://twitter.com/ajtowns/status/1555784636927655937)) this does seem like a legitimate way that a responsibly managed fiat currency can reduce or avoid recessions.

But this also seems to me like a real case where central banks economists and financial engineers have a meaningful future, even in an all Bitcoin future. The central bank could, for instance, issue an inflationary currency backed by deflationary one -- if you say $10,000 today is worth 0.5 BTC, and inflate the dollar while deflating BTC, you end up with, perhaps $10,250 in a year being worth 0.495 BTC. But of course that's only if it's reliable -- if BTC becomes inflationary (due to the savings rate dropping massively), perhaps your $10,250 requires 0.525 BTC to back it, and you're screwed. But if everyone is really interested in holding BTC anyway, the central bank doesn't actually need to issue a token -- all it really needs to do is release an exchange rate. 1 BTC = $20,000 today, 1 BTC = $20707 in a year, 1 BTC = $19,523 when the savings rate plummets. Wages and goods can then be priced in dollars, but paid in BTC, with no one actually holding dollars, and no one suffering a risk of a bank run due to holding dollars that are suddenly unbacked.

That system would have some strange behaviours (if it is even possible to implement in the real world). In particular, a rise in the "savings rate", once reflected in the changing exchange rate of the dollar, would, in dollar terms, immediately increase the value of everyone's savings, presumably to the point where, again in dollar terms, everyone is still willing to buy roughly as many goods and services as they were previously (avoding a drop in GDP and a recession). However in bitcoin terms, the new exchange rate and their wages/income being fixed in dollar terms, would mean that they receive less BTC every month, making it harder to continue to grow their savings in percentage terms. Perhaps that simply means that if the desire for savings increases again, then the central bank will adapt by again decreasing the exchange rate, and everyone will be satisfied, but it's not clear to me that there wouldn't be some more complicated result.

In any event, the key issue there is simply one of collective bargaining: businesses and workers and consumers agree to coordinate automatic mild price cuts (in BTC terms) via their national central bank for both wages and goods. In all cases they can opt out of this, either by changing their prices or by renegotiating their salary; but in the normal case, (if it's workable) it provides an easy way to address bumps in the economy in a way that, hopefully, affects everyone equally.

This resonates with me. Rephrasing your thoughts in my own words:

- Passive investments logically won't reliably generate a return, only active investments can (i.e. you can't get something for nothing)

- Currently passively investments are used to escape inflation – this arguably creates allocation of capital where it shouldn't be allocated (housing, stocks)

- Despite this downside, one possible claim is that inflation is needed to ensure stable pricing of products, wages, loans.

- We can get the best of both worlds by pricing these things in fiat (inflationary), but always saving/settling in BTC (deflationary)

>However in bitcoin terms, the new exchange rate and their wages/income being fixed in dollar terms, would mean that they receive less BTC every month, making it harder to continue to grow their savings in percentage terms

I would argue this is already the case today, since many people have a large part of their savings in passive investments.

>agree to coordinate automatic mild price cuts (in BTC terms) via their national central bank

Do you think this type of agreement won't arise from the free market and has to be managed by a central bank?

Lastly, just to add a bit of nuance that I'm sure you'll agree with, I'll say that I don't think everyone will want to hold their full savings in BTC – some will prefer to pay a percentage to hedge away the volatility.

I don't think you want to have many different pricing systems; you wouldn't want one shop to be operating in AlphaDollars and the shop next door to be operating in BetaDollars (would make it hard to do price comparisons, would make things difficult if people being paid wages by one store want to buy goods at the other store), and that's probably true even for nearby cities. If you only had one fiat currency across a large area, then whoever's in control of that fiat currency has a lot of influence on the economy, so having some accountability via elected representatives seems reasonable. Also, seems likely that it would be hard to setup that sort of system without a legal mandate along the lines of "all goods must have their price in dollars listed" or "salaried employees must be offered their salary in dollar terms and those terms cannot be decreased more often than once every three months" or something.

I think of it more as distinguishing "investment" (you've bought some assets), "savings" (money/bitcoins) and "transaction funds" (cash you're planning on spending soon) -- so hedging would be me converting from bitcoin in savings to dollars in your transaction account. So I'd be happy to argue "holding their full savings in BTC" is a good idea with that definition. :smile:

I'm not sure whether that savings/transaction hedging is better done with actual "dollars" that the central bank would mint and redeem, or privately with future/options contracts or similar financial instruments. If a clever financial instrument could work, that could be done privately, which might reduce systemic risk -- if one bank makes a mistake, it might only affect their customers, while if the central bank makes a mistake it necessarily affects everyone.

I think a systemic problem in this case would be if "dollars" end up undercollateralised -- your balance says $20,000 but there's ultimately only 0.9 BTC backing it, and the central bank says 0.9 BTC is worth $18,000 say. In that case there's two choices: all the banks that messed up go through bankruptcy proceedings (and you're given 0.9 BTC quickly and perhaps another 0.5B from sale of the bank's tangible assets, and you've effectively lost $1000/5% of you transaction account balance), or the central bank devalues their fiat currency, so that now you need $20,000 or more to buy 0.9 BTC. If the central bank chooses to devalue it to avoid systemic risk, despite its CPI target not giving it a reason to, that would then cause corresponding (demand-driven?) price inflation.

>I don’t think you want to have many different pricing systems

I see your point. It's good if everyone converges on the same price index, but this also gives power to the indexer, so for this reason governments might be the preferred party to do this.

>So I’d be happy to argue “holding their full savings in BTC” is a good idea with that definition. :smile:

Haha fair enough, what I mean is what you define as “transaction funds”.

>not sure whether that savings/transaction hedging is better done with actual “dollars” that the central bank would mint and redeem, or privately with future/options contracts or similar

I'm thinking the latter. Arguably most money already works like that since 90%+ of it is lent out (i.e. invested) and the banks are running a fractional reserve.

>I think a systemic problem in this case would be if “dollars” end up undercollateralised

Yeah, in the current monetary system governments basically eliminate the risk of bank insolvency by being a [lender of last resort](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/working-paper/2011/the-history-of-interbank-settlement-arrangements-exploring-central-banks.pdf). If you remove this insurance and let the risk be separate, then a (collateralized) dollar from bank A won't be the same as dollar from bank B, which creates many inefficiencies that you'd rather not have to deal with. As you alluded to in your previous post, there's no reason this kind of insurance can't still exist.
