# op_CAT vs op_CTV vs XMR

I have been very skeptical about monero but I don't think bitcoin can become cash, so something has to be cash.

Either Lightning takes that role or we have to rely on monero.

I don't know how much taproot and segwit has reduced the [fungibility] (https://sethforprivacy.com/posts/fungibility-graveyard/) of bitcoin and how much sender privacy is there in lightning (maybe if you trust the node/channel the sender is on), but for something to be cash, it has to retain price, and I think monero is it (for now)

I actually like the CTV soft fork or we can just have pools via [OP_CAT]. (https://github.com/taproot-wizards/purrfect_vault/issues/1#issuecomment-2513445570) But monero is it.

I believe Bitcoin is money but monero is cash, as Bitcoin is not fungible & lightning adoption will be slow, I try to put my thoughts about this here: (hope linking my blog is fine, otherwise, I will remove it, mostly I want to discuss what I am thinking)
