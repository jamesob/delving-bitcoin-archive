# op_CAT vs op_CTV vs XMR

I have been very skeptical about monero but I don't think bitcoin can become cash, so something has to be cash.

Either Lightning takes that role or we have to rely on monero.

I don't know how much taproot and segwit has reduced the [fungibility] (https://sethforprivacy.com/posts/fungibility-graveyard/) of bitcoin and how much sender privacy is there in lightning (maybe if you trust the node/channel the sender is on), but for something to be cash, it has to retain price, and I think monero is it (for now)

I actually like the CTV soft fork or we can just have pools via [OP_CAT]. (https://github.com/taproot-wizards/purrfect_vault/issues/1#issuecomment-2513445570) But monero is it.

I believe Bitcoin is money but monero is cash, as Bitcoin is not fungible & lightning adoption will be slow, I try to put my thoughts about this here: (hope linking my blog is fine, otherwise, I will remove it, mostly I want to discuss what I am thinking)

This is a reply from an economics point of view, contra Monero.

1. Bitcoin can become cash (currency for the real economy).
2. It is PRIMARILY held back by an economic issue, not a technical one. Monero has the same problem. Let's call it volatility but there is more to it. 
3. I think the best way for bitcoin to become cash is a bitcoin based Chaumian ecash layer. Long story.
4. Lightning is needed for the total system but is not 'cash' per se.
5. Bitcoin-based ecash has blinded signatures, this gives great fungibility.
6. No CTV needed (for this cash goal). If just for that, Core can just stay as is.

I am currently writing up the economic problem and a proposed solution which is already being developed. If interested, here are the first two chapters: https://blog.bitcr.org/p/the-bitcoin-dilemma-store-of-value-or-medium-of-exchange.
