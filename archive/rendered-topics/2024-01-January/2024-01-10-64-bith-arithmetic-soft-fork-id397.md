# 64 bith arithmetic soft fork

Hi all, when reviewing OP_TLUV mailing list posts it became clear that 64bit arithmetic would be a subset of necessary changes to enable something like TLUV. I've heard from other protocol developers that 64bit arithmetic operations would be useful to their protocols as well. 

Here is a live link to my BIP proposal: https://github.com/Christewart/bips/pull/1

and the implementation: 

https://github.com/Christewart/bitcoin/pull/2

I figured I would try posting here to see if there is any early feedback before sending to the mailing list. Apologies if this isn't the right format for this venue.
