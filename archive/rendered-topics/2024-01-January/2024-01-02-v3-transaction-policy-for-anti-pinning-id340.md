# V3 transaction policy for anti-pinning

AntoineP | 2024-01-02 09:36:47 UTC | #1

"V3" is an opt-in constrained transaction relay policy proposed by Gloria Zhao to mitigate pinning. It is often discussed in conjunction with Greg Sanders' "[ephemeral anchors](https://github.com/instagibbs/bips/blob/7d79c5692bb745bf158f2d8f8e4979d80ad07e58/bip-ephemeralanchors.mediawiki)". With the upcoming phasing out of the mailing list, i'm opening this thread to discuss v3 at a high level.

For context Peter Todd recently wrote a [blog post](https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review) with the following conclusion:
> V3 transactions should not be be shipped at the moment. It has no compelling use-cases right now without ephemeral outputs, which should be discouraged, and in its current form is still vulnerable to transaction pinning.

Discussion about it [is happening on the Bitcoin Core PR](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28948#issuecomment-1873490509), and i think this thread is a more appropriate forum to discuss the merits of the v3 proposal at a high level.

Thanks, I've linked this in the PR description

moving discussion here...

> Again, I am not denying that there is a 100x reduction in the hypothetical situation of transaction pinning. What I am pointing out is that Lightning already fixed that transaction pinning problem with the design of anchor channels, making your 100x reduction irrelevant.

If an adversary splits the view of which commitment transaction is broadcasted, the remote copy can become the pin since the defender is unable to propagate their spend of the remote commit tx anchor(as their peers do not have the remote commit tx)

> But *even that* is actually incorrect: the highest feerate you could ever possibly need is the one where all of your balance in the channel goes to fees.

I don't think that's correct. As a simplified motivating example, if we set reserve amounts to 0, if you want to send "all" your funds, your top feerate will be zero, even if the total funds recoverable in timeout would be all your remaining liquidity.

I'm sure there are ways to mitigate this, like capping total HTLC exposure as a % of liquidity, but it's pretty clearly a reduction in functionality? Possibly completely broken as it implies that you can never drain your liquidity completely to reserve levels?

In his [post](https://petertodd.org/2023/v3-transactions-review), Peter Todd says:

> For example, if you wanted to cover 10satvB to 1000satvB, with 10% increments, youâ€™d only need 50 fee variants, for a total size of 3200 bytes, taking just 5ms to sign (single core). Given the very good scalability of Lightning, this overhead is reasonable.

I think this ignores a possible effect of [stuckless payments](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/redundant-overpayments/) on the LN network.  If Alice wants to pay Zed 100,000 sats using a refundable overpayment of 20 parts each at 10,000 sats, Zed is likely to claim the first 10 parts that arrive and decline the remaining 10 parts.  The nodes that forwarded the claimed parts will receive forwarding fees; the other nodes will not be compensated.

Nodes that forward payments faster will, when all other things are equal, be more likely to receive payment than nodes that forward payments slower.  In a regime with stuckless payments, I think 5 ms (plus the extra time to transmit several KB of musig2 partial signatures) is large enough that it may result in a significant reduction in forwarding node revenue compared to forwarding nodes that can send just a single partial signature.  That would push forwarding nodes towards a lower-latency single commitment scheme, such as those based on CPFP.
