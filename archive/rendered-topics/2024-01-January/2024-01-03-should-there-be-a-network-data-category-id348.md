# Should there be a "Network Data" category?

What do you think about adding a category about Bitcoin (network) data with the primary goal of requesting/sharing/discussing data (unprocessed or processed as, e.g, graphs) related to Bitcoin development?

Personally, I think moving requests like the following to a forum where I can reply with images and multiple people can join in and discuss would be beneficial.
- @AntoineP on IRC: "do you have data about the percentage of fees in the block reward in the past years by any chance? Or anyone else of course"
- @ajtowns on IRC: "did you see tx vbyte volume in september comparable to https://mempool.space/graphs/mempool#6m ? (or anyone else ofc)"
- @instagibbs on X: https://twitter.com/theinstagibbs/status/1742285787494748254
- ...

That sounds reasonable to me. I know a few other people have an interest in data collection and processing. Regrouping discussions and requests here would be beneficial.
