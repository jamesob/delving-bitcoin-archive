# Antoine Poinsot on Bitcoin Core's Priorities

@AntoineP wrote three interesting blog posts on Bitcoin Core:

 * https://antoinep.com/posts/core_project_direction/
   * *"I think we are in this situation where everybody is working on their own thing and there is no broad agreement about what the scope of the project should even be. As a consequence, year after year we keep piling up more code, more features, more RPCs, etc.. with at best a constant amount of competent reviewers’ time. This is not tenable, as a focus which gets further dispersed will inevitably lead to reduced overall software quality."*

   * *"When you consider that Bitcoin Core’s userbase is indirectly all Bitcoin users, how to prioritise development becomes quite clear. Bitcoin Core should be a robust backbone for the Bitcoin network, balancing between securing the Bitcoin Core software and implementing new features to strengthen and improve the Bitcoin network."*
 * https://antoinep.com/posts/bitcoin_core_scope/
   * *"The multiprocess project presents an opportunity in this regard. Separate `bitcoin-node`, `bitcoin-wallet` and `bitcoin-gui` binaries communicating through well-defined interfaces open the door to splitting the current project into 3. The contributors at [github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) would focus on the Bitcoin Core node and release a `bitcoin-node` program, exposing JSONRPC and IPC interfaces. The contributors at [github.com/bitcoin-core/wallet](https://antoinep.com/posts/bitcoin_core_scope/github.com/bitcoin-core/wallet) would work on the `bitcoin-wallet` process. The Bitcoin Core wallet releases would contain both the wallet and node processes, presumably with a wrapper to make it transparent to users. This project would release the equivalent of today’s `bitcoind`. Finally, the contributors at [github.com/bitcoin-core/gui](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui) would develop and release the `bitcoin-gui` program, which would ship with the node and wallet."*

Next thing to figure out would be how to handle the shared code and configuration. What i had in mind was that the wallet would have the node as a subtree, likewise the GUI with the wallet. There is some common code that could be mostly split (`src/crypto`) but other (`src/util`, `src/common`, ..) will have to either be duplicate or become another interface between the projects.

Copying the configuration (the CI for instance) seems less concerning. Then the other big thing to figure out (which is a blind spot for me) is how we would organize the build system. cc @fanquake maybe you can clue me in.
