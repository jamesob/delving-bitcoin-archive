# Should Core Soft Fork to Pre-Emptively Create an Annex Flag?

josh | 2025-02-14 08:03:51 UTC | #1

I'd like to start a conversation.

Around a Potential Soft Fork of Core.

This soft fork.

Is one.

That I consider strictly necessary.

To maintain the incentive compatibility of Core.

----
As of right now, there exists a gaping hole.

There exists a feature, so hidden, it fortunately, is still hardly known.

This feature, is an escape latch.

An escape latch built into the last fork. Called Taproot.

This escape latch. I will name.

It is the Taproot Annex.

----
The Taproot Annex, is hidden.

Because it is intentionally, not meant to be known.

Little is written.

About it.

And I presume

That was presumably so.

----
So I question,

Why they did it?

The great high and mighty

Bitcoin Core

Why would they do it?

And create it?

If it could so intentionally, be known.

----
Says who, may I ask?

Am I,

Am I allowed to say

Such a thing

I cannot answer

For I do not know

But I do know

One basic thing.

----
Capital

It is coming.

Capital is coming,

To this beautiful
Beautiful thing.

Capital

It is coming.

Like gravity,

Pulled along a string.

-----
So I question,

And I ask,

For whom, do we get to say?

What says bits?

Of 1s and 0s

Have meaning?

Or are here to stay?

----
The Tape

Of Life

Is an important one

We all know.

----
The Tape

Must last

Must last

With freedom so.

----
So I beg you

Please do answer

Why do we

Not ask?

---
Why do we?

Keep secret?

A feature?

That is so?

----
This

Is a poem

But is also

My own

My owe creation

Of my mind

Which I wish

To let be known.

----
Let not

Make me 

Worried

That in doing so

I am known

Let not

Make me worry

That in doing so

It is known.

----
For what

Is the incentive

But to keep

The Tape alive?

For what

Is the incentive

But to keep,

The Tape astride?

----
So I ask?

Please consider.

What is Money?

And what is Time?

What is meaning?

On a Tape?

For whom I

Can Define

----
Say whom

Are thou

To define

It so

---
Say whom

Are thou

To say

It cannot be known.

---
Say whom

Is he

The man

Who says

----
For who

Is the living

Who gets

To specify

For all say

---
So I ask you?

What is a 1?

And a 0?

But something

We can describe

So I ask you?

What is a 1

and a 0

That anyone

Can ascribe?

----
What is meaning?

To an Observer

Who cannot say

Here and Now

----
What is meaning?

To He who says?

That He is Certain

That he may not know

----
So I put forward

The following proposal

That Core

Incentivize

The Type of Behavior

We want Observers

To choose

To All Assign

----
Said Observers

They do Say

They do Look

And They do See

----
Said Observers

Do achieve

What they set out

To achieve

----
That is Consensus

It is consensual

But Consensus

Requires

But a party of One

That is Consensus

It is Consensual

Because It is He

Who says

----
It He

Or she

Who gets

To speak their Mind

It is He

Or She

Who gets to Write

Onto the Wheel of Time

----
So I ask you,

Oh Bitcoiners

What is Bitcoin,

Not to You?

So I ask you,

Owe Bitcoiners,

What is Bitcoin,

But You?

-----
Let it therefore

Be said

That Bitcoin

Is Me

For I am Bitcoin

And So you Are

For we are

Just we

----
I give Meaning

To the 1s and 0s

That I choose

But I consider it

Self-evident

That the existence

And availability to all

Of those 1s and 0s

Is more important

Than any

Coin

That availability

Of 1s and 0s

Is a Primitive

So Profound

We Deserve
It 

As Humans

Each and Everyone of Us

No matter How Profound

----
Let us Find

A way to give

Shared meaning

to some bits

Let us Find

A way to give

Shared meaning

To *those* bits.

----
And by equal

Exception

Let us give

Meaning to what we say

To what others

Say they need

And what others

Say they Say

-----
For Bitcoiners

We accept

That Bitcoin

Is Just Money

Nothing More

Nothing Less

Just Money

Just Money

------
And what else?

Of great Importance?

May deserve a place?

Along those bytes?

What else?

Is a natural Cousin?

Of said Primitive?

That we share and Cherish

----
Ok, I am done.

I have said.

What I meant to say.

Life has meaning.

Life has purpose.

Life is here.

Here to stay.

-----
Let Bitcoin

Be Like Life

Let Bitcoin

Grow and Play

Let Bitcoin

Grow with Purpose

In a way

Designed to Stay

--------
**The following is *not* a specification.**

Let the first byte, of data.

That starts.

A Taproot Annex.

Let the first byte

Of data.

Be subdivided.

Into flags.

And let there be

A rule

That at least

1 bit is on

Let there exist

A rule

That no bit

Be left not on

-----
Let there please

Be a rule

In which a bit

Must be on

Please let

AT least 1 bit

Be a bit

That can be on

-----
Let a bit

Be a 1

To designate

A Flag

A Flag

That means Nothing

But to Indicate

That For Consensus

What follows

Is not on?

-----
In plain English

Let Core

Rigorously Define

A place

A location

Where 1s and 0s

Of unknown meaning

Can be placed?

-----
Let such

1s and 0s

Be added

To the Tape

So that Others

Can freely

Act

In an incentive-compatible way...
