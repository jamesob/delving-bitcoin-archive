# BSST v0.1.4: license change to AGPLv3 (no other changes)

I have changed the license for B'SST (https://github.com/dgpv/bsst ) from proprietary license to AGPLv3

This is basically the only difference between v0.1.3 and v0.1.4 (except for one minor fix)

But still I've decided to make this post to inform people who might have feel limited by the previous proprietary license.
