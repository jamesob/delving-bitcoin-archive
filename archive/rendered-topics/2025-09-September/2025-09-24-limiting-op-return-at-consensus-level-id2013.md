# Limiting OP_RETURN at consensus level

Dears, 

TLDR: Would it be acceptable to limit OP_RETURN at consensus level?

Why? Spam and worse can end up onchain, be it via core or any other client in a **contiguous form**. We’ve all seen the discussions. In fact, there have been that many discussions, I’m afraid we’ve woken up some sleeping dogs.

I’m a EU citizen. We see weekly in the news, reporting on CS$M. 
This goes together with the EU parliament forcing through ChatControl on all of us to “combat CS$M”. It’s of course just to get more control.

If some have gotten any notion of what is possible with OP_RETURN and that it remains onchain forever, I can see them abuse it and try to regulatory strangle Bitcoin and the Exchanges.
Companies might not want to touch it anymore, might not even be allowed to touch it anymore.

Just a few weeks ago some reporters “found” CS$M on X, it was all over the news.
I don’t believe for a second they just happened to “find” it.
They enforce platforms to remove what they deem violates law. 

Saying Bitcoin is just a protocol will not stop them from attacking it, hence I feel we should be prepared and mitigate.

I am not purposely trying to sound alarmist, I’ve just seen the EU change so much, we can expect everything. I also believe Bitcoin would survive such an attack, but it would suffer for a while.
