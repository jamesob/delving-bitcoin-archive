Rebuilding Coinstatsindex to the new power-failure-safe one on pruned nodes with very low-power CPU takes days (like any IBD would there).

Would it be possible to provide a migration script in case muhash is still in sync with some recent known one?

For example, does this (still in the old coinstatsindex) look good? Comparing to my another pruned nodeâ€™s (running 29.1) output it is in sync.

```
$ bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo muhash 915117
{
  "height": 915117,
