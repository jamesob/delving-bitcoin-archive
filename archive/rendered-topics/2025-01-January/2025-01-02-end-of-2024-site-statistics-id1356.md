Apparently end of year site statistics is a thing. Here's delving's stats for daily logged in user visits, aggregated for each month, for the past two years.
 
```plotly
data:
        - x: ['2023-01', '2023-02', '2023-05', '2023-06', '2023-07', '2023-08', '2023-09', '2023-10', '2023-11', '2023-12', '2024-01', '2024-02', '2024-03', '2024-04', '2024-05', '2024-06', '2024-07', '2024-08', '2024-09', '2024-10', '2024-11', '2024-12']
          y: [22, 5, 17, 26, 22, 148, 200, 293, 475, 831, 1536, 1482, 1671, 1545, 1486, 1407, 1149, 1106, 1238, 1266, 1251, 1315]

The site traffic report had an [upgrade](https://meta.discourse.org/t/better-pageview-metrics-with-the-new-site-traffic-report/324068/10) mid 2024 to better handle uninteresting automated traffic, but only the legacy version has consistent data going back more than six months. For whatever that's worth, it looks like:

The number of new posts per month graph looks like:
