# Mailing list mode

I've turned off the "disable mailing list mode" switch. Not super convinced that's a good idea: subscribing to tags or categories seems like a better bet in general, and most of the comments I've seen about it seem negative, eg https://meta.discourse.org/t/completely-disable-mailing-list-mode/37334

Anyway, if you want to try it out, go to your preferences (favicon in the top right, head-and-shoulders icons down the side; preferences; email tab).
