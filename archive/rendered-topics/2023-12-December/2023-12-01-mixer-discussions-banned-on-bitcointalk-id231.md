In light of this, I am curious as to the stance Delving Bitcoin takes on the matter?

Per https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/welcome-to-delving-bitcoin/7

> This site is for technical discussions with the goal of understanding Bitcoin and helping it last for the long term.

I think advertising products and services ("linking to mixers", "advertising mixers") would already be off-topic, while discussing research and open source software that covers mixing technology would be fine ("OK to discuss mixers in a general sort of way").
