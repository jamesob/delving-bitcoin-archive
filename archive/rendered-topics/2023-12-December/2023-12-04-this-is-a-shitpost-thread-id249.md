# This is a shitpost thread

This is a shit post thread to get a feel of the forum, and also how the [mailing list mode works](https://racket.discourse.group/t/how-to-enable-mailing-list-mode/167) in practice (I activated it before making this thread). 

In particular, I want to see how the emails are sent: if they include context, prior replies at the end, etc, etc. 


$\sqrt{(-1)} \; 2^3 \; \sum \; \pi$

$\mathbb{R}$

Here's what the initial email looked like for me for the first reply (and my reply after that)

Sadly email responses are currently disabled, I've asked AJ if he'd enable them, but he has some spam concerns currently that I think he's investigating.

The threads are threadlike
